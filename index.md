# eyeofparadox.com -> eyeofparadox.github.io

I’ve been scratching out ideas since the writing bug first bit me in grade school. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I always had this notion that I was going to devote some part of my life to writing. Of course, I’ve spent much more time thinking, while trying to find time to get anything written! 

Inevitably, when the time came to start writing, I had thoughts waiting to be expressed. I used to just spill them out in a notepad and file them away. Sometime in 2007, I tripped over a link to **Helium** (long gone now) and started responding to writing prompts. After publishing my tenth article, I got an itch for something more. I wanted to keep exploring the ideas that bit me, and that really called for something more like a blog.

I started by creating [**eyeofparadox**](https://eyeofparadox.com) on WordPress, reposting my **Helium** articles. I added essays, articles, journals, and bits of work-in-progress fiction as the impulse to write kicked in--however randomly--sometimes going years between posts. Mostly, my blog was a place I could just capture my thoughts before they could escape me. I was not going to try to support myself doing it. I didn't have a particular audience in mind, and the writing served no greater purpose than *external memory* (a [**Ghost in the Shell**](https://github.com/eyeofparadox/eyeofparadox.github.io/masamune-shiro--ghost-in-the-shell--manga-anime.md) reference, for the uniniated).

The fact that it was open to the public did not escape me, but I'm the kind of person who feels, if an idea is worth putting down in writing, then it might be worth reading for some people. Most of the time, that works just fine. 

I carried that philosophy to other sites I created, including GitHub. Originally, I used GitHub for more technical things, but the benefits of using it to manage my writing archives were clear. I would also be able to take advantage of Copilot to help with indexing and cross-referencing decades worth of material more efficiently. I intend to get the static pages up on [eyeofparadox.github.io](https://eyeofparadox.github.io/) as soon as I can get Hugo to build them properly. I might need to make some manual adjustments for that.

If you divide by nothing, in one sense, you get nothing. In another sense, you are left with everything. However much there is to divide, all of it remains - undivided. The remainder is everything. To count it all, however, you must divide it up into discrete quantities. Of course, you can keep dividing it \[...\]

On any given day, a small handful of people find their way to the eye of paradox. Some of them probably just glance at an article to see if it's relevant to the search that brought them here. One or two might actually read something. Once in a blue moon, someone leaves a short comment. \[...\]

Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view.

To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes.

## [Open Letter to Lindsay Lohan](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/08/09/open-letter-to-lindsay-lohan/)

[August 9, 2007](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/08/09/open-letter-to-lindsay-lohan/)

Hello, Lindsay. I don't know you and you certainly do not know me! That said, I do not really expect you to actually read this letter, and if you do, I really do not expect anything from you. Still, it is an open letter for you, and regardless of who else reads it, it is \[...\]

## [The Price of Admission](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/08/06/the-price-of-admission/)

[August 6, 2007November 16, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/08/06/the-price-of-admission/)

What is a society, what is it made up of and how does it work? The simple answer is, jobs. Society is all about jobs. Living in the wild, surviving on their own, human beings had no jobs. Their lives were defined by the tasks that needed to be done in order to be able \[...\]

## [Time in a Distributed, Process Driven, Information-Based Universe](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/30/time-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/)

[July 30, 2007November 17, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/30/time-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/)

In order to understand time it becomes necessary to ask if time is an objective or subjective medium. To be clear, by considering time subjectively I do not mean simply in terms of our subjective perception of time. The question asks if time is absolute, and thus events at different points in time persist in \[...\]

## [That Itch to Write](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/29/that-itch-to-write/)

[July 29, 2007](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/29/that-itch-to-write/)

It seems that the itch to start working on a book has come back to me. It has to be an insane impulse, because with school and work I have no idea where I'll find time to actually write anything. Then there's the fact that I'll be moving in the next few weeks and looking \[...\]

## [What is evil?](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/25/what-is-evil/)

[July 25, 2007November 16, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/25/what-is-evil/)

There is a line in "The Matrix" when Morpheus confronts Neo about a wrongness in the world, "like a splinter in your mind." It was caused by an instinctive apprehension of the artificial reality he was trapped in. It is similar to a feeling many people have about our own reality. There is a wrongness \[...\]

[July 20, 2007August 17, 2016](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/20/gid/)

In my bio on Helium, I confided a history of GID. That is Gender Identity Disorder, for those of you who did not know. There are a number of problems with that particular label for a condition that is poorly understood at best and entirely subjective at worst. Other terms that can be used are \[...\]

[July 18, 2007November 17, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/explaining-the-different-dimensions/)

I normally avoid the first person when writing an article or essay, but in this case I need to begin with a personal story A year into my studies at Humboldt State University a mutual acquaintance showed up at my friend's apartment while I was visiting and regaled us with his synopsis of a lecture \[...\]

## [Is there really such a thing as the present?](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-the-present/)

[July 18, 2007November 18, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/is-there-really-such-a-thing-as-the-present/)

Is there really such a thing as time? That is a question it is helpful to ask in order to address what we call the present. That is because our experience of time is completely subjective and because everything we are is dependent on that peculiar subjectivity. Time is what we derive from the ceaseless \[...\]

[July 18, 2007November 18, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/noosphere-the-future-of-evolution/)

Those moments in life when we are confronted with a new concept or idea can be life altering, seemingly setting the mind free to roam a new and undiscovered country or even knocking the world completely off its hinges. Sometimes that can happen even with just a new word or concept for something we've had \[...\]

## [The Purpose of Religion](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/the-purpose-of-religion/)

[July 18, 2007November 18, 2025](https://eyeofparadox.com/2007/07/18/the-purpose-of-religion/)

In asking about the purpose of religion, it is necessary to ask first if religion is not simply a product of our own search for purpose? The answer to the primary question depends on whether we perceive religion as having a divine origin or if we see it as the origin of divine thinking. Either \[...\]

Posted on Helium under: The fundamentals of self-awareness The mind is an inherently fascinating and difficult subject to pin down. Philosophers have been musing over the mysteries of the mind for thousands of years but it is, without doubt, the scientists who find it the most frustrating to study. The subjective nature of the mind \[...\]

Among the features not provided for contributors on the now-defunct Helium writer's website was a way for readers to respond directly to the writers. While it was active, the only way for readers to respond on Helium was by posting their own thoughts on the topic at hand. Those who were so inclined were welcome to do so, there, \[...\]

I've been scratching out ideas since the writing bug first bit me in grade school. Somewhere in the back of my mind I always had this notion that I was going to devote some part of my life to writing. Of course, I've spent much more time thinking, while trying to find time to get \[...\]

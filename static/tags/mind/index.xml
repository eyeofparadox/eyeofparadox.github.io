      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction to the Doctrine of &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;„&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Notation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind &lt;strong&gt;„&lt;/strong&gt; notation originated from a necessity—how do we create a &lt;strong&gt;concise, yet expressive&lt;/strong&gt; system for defining structured relationships between elements? Whether dealing with &lt;strong&gt;datasets, filenames, computational hierarchies, or exclusions&lt;/strong&gt;, conventional formats often lacked clarity or introduced unnecessary ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This notation emerged as a &lt;strong&gt;solution&lt;/strong&gt;, offering a way to &lt;strong&gt;track divisions, subsets, sequencing, and structured logic&lt;/strong&gt; in a simple yet powerful syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you divide by nothing, in one sense, you get nothing. In another sense, you are left with everything. However much there is to divide, all of it remains - undivided. The remainder is everything. To count it all, however, you must divide it up into discrete quantities. Of course, you can keep dividing it into smaller and smaller parts, each of which is increasingly infinitesimal. As you do so, the number you are calculating approaches infinity. This is the paradox of division by zero.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My eyes opened and this is what I saw. You can in yourself be anything you desire. You create yourself from a point. You define your own existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A soul defines itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What words cannot define, they can characterize, so that the truth may be recognized as it is encountered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The existence of a soul is absolute, at once all and nothing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The qualities of a soul are both infinite and eternal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A soul is not a question, nor is a soul an answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A soul is a statement.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A soul is an expression, a unique, individual creation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I gazed in wonder, I realized that even before a soul embraces the awareness of other souls, the darkness of a soul embraces the light of other souls, filling the emptiness of its existence with the certainty of others, both as a foundation for its own reality, and a medium for the realization of its self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Staring into the Face of Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Matter and Movement in Four--or More--Dimensions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, it only takes a little curiosity, access to the Internet, and a bit of patience to find explanations of progressive spatial dimensions or examples of four dimensional geometry, such as the old favorite the hyper-square.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you will find use analogies like Flatland, or animations which is a way of using time and motion to reveal a higher dimensional object using a lower dimensional cross section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Glimpse into the Eye of Paradox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On any given day, a small handful of people find their way to the eye of paradox. Some of them probably just glance at an article to see if it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to the search that brought them here. One or two might actually read something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once in a blue moon, someone leaves a short comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, I do not see anything to indicate that my words mean much. Is that frustrating?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

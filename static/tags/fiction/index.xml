      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across a few things I wrote for a creative writing class I took this past spring to fulfill an elective requirement. One of the assignments involved writing a short story based on a work of art found online. I had no trouble thinking of one that sparked my imagination. The painting &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kyena.deviantart.com/art/Summer-comes-30814005&#34;&gt;Summer Comes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Kyena was posted on DeviantArt on March 24, 2006, receiving special notice on April 12, 2006 as a &amp;ldquo;Daily Deviation&amp;rdquo; or a featured artwork on the popular artists&amp;rsquo; community site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We never remember the beginning,&amp;rdquo; she said quietly. &amp;ldquo;We pretend not to know why—but then that is one of our favorite tricks, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; she glanced up at me, smiling at my confused silence. With her arms crossed she began to drift about the room, examining objects while continuing this strange introduction. &amp;ldquo;We pretend not to know many things. We can even pretend not to know the truth. The horrible truth. But the beginning?&amp;rdquo; she paused and met my eye in the mirror. &amp;ldquo;Well there is an explanation for that one. We never remember the beginning because there never was a beginning. That&amp;rsquo;s one of those horrible parts of the truth we choose to miss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

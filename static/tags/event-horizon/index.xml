      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I stumble across a question I have to stop and ask, but I am usually in the middle of something that needs to be done. So, I put it off for later, often forgetting to even write the question down. I know this one is going to come back to plague me, so I am putting it out there in the hopes I can come back and do some research on it later, while giving the random visitor to my site a chance to comment on it or point me toward a source with something to say about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

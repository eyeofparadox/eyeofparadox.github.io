      <title>Is This It?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my way home on Wednesday, September 23, 2009, with my dinner in hand, and I swear I just wanted to sit down and eat but I knew the bus would show up the minute I did. I had intended to eat in the restaurant, but for some reason the counter person handed me my meal in a bag to go. Since my usual table was occupied, I sighed and left; the entire day had been off like that. I should have known the universe had it in for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 27, 2008 at 12:36 am, I began a post &amp;ndash; this post, actually &amp;ndash; but got no further than the title. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was because that title summed up my feelings so well that there was no point to writing any further about what was on my mind. Yesterday, those words came back to me at the conclusion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2009/07/06/a-glimpse-into-the-eye-of-paradox/&#34;&gt;A Glimpse into the Eye of Paradox&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of the truth as something that is hidden in plain sight, and approached it as something that we take so much for granted we really don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it. One might as well say that the truth that can be put into words is not the truth. Communication is more a matter of interpretation, and there is no singularity to interpretation. The truth is out there, and every time we encounter it, we are seeing it from a limited point of view. When we come across it again from a different point of view, we still recognize it as the truth but it not only appears different, we ourselves understand it in a different context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A True Identity is Nothing to Fear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response I received to my last post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2008/05/11/conundrum/&#34;&gt;Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;, prompted me to check out the recent posts of the people who commented or posted blogs in the transgender category yesterday. As a result, I became aware of the outcry against the appointment of Dr. Kenneth Zucker, Dr. Ray Blanchard, and J. Michael Bailey, by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), to the work group responsible for revising the entry for Gender Identity Disorder (GID) in the Manual for Diagnosis of Mental Disorders. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/the-apa-appointment-of-zucker-et-al-and-gender-variant-children/&#34;&gt;first blog&lt;/a&gt; I read on the subject, posted by Gender Outlaw, struck a very personal chord with me. In addition to being transgendered, I was put up for adoption when I was four and spent a year in foster care while the state attempted to contact my biological father so that he might claim his custody rights. It was during my time in foster care that I was terrorized out of identifying myself as a girl and learned to keep my true identity a secret. It took time to learn how to restrain my natural impulses and act like a boy, and the threat of abandonment and rejection was used to reinforce &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; behavior. By the time I was adopted, this conditioning had scarred me for life, rendering me incapable of trusting anyone with my true thoughts and feelings. When my new family noticed my feminine traits and confronted me with questions about my behavior, or offered even a mild rebuke for &amp;ldquo;acting like a girl&amp;rdquo; I was consumed with that fear of rejection and lied to deflect any suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Conundrum</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I find myself puzzling over the weird fact of my existence. The Internet created an opportunity to show a side of myself that I had long kept hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am, at least in the terms used by the medical community (and by extension, the LGBTQ community), transgendered; in spite of being born and raised male the core of my identity is female.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not a convenient or desirable situation, and it puts me in constant conflict between who I am and what I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Stratification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all human. None of us have a say in what circumstances we are born. Pretty much any other characteristic by which people can be defined produces some form of social stratification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with the ideas of caste and class, and tried to understand how anyone can willingly accept being &amp;ldquo;put in their place&amp;rdquo; by the people around them. In the end, I think it all comes down to the perception of power, the ways in which circumstances can be used to dominate society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Paying the Price</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2007/08/2007-08-13-paying-the-price/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As true as it is that some people are incapable of valuing things they have not paid the price for, the fact is that free money is never free. There is terrible cost for being on the public dole, that is immediately evident when you walk into a welfare community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being on public assistance or living on a reservation, the cost of that free income or housing is having to live in poverty. It provides just enough to survive but not enough to advance. While many assistance programs include job training and placement programs, the jobs one can qualify for rarely provide better incomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Take a Moment to Reflect</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even with the best intentions no one has the right to impose a system of thought or action on anyone against their will. Ironically, that is exactly what has happened to all of us as we were born into this world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is in some ways no different than being born into slavery, in the sense that we come into the world having no say in the system that will govern our lives, and we spend our most vulnerable years being programmed to become obedient citizens and uphold the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Best Way to Fit In? Don&#39;t Stand Out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grouping is an activity that comes instinctively and automatically to people. It is part of a filtering process that allows us to make sense of our universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything can serve as criteria for grouping, but because this is a perceptual-interpretive process; differences and similarities in physical characteristics are the most prevalent. As we learn and grow, we also associate ideas and experiences with the items in our cognitive inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We give values to people, places and things based on personal experience, inherited attitudes and beliefs, and assumptions. Part of our ability to form instant impressions and make immediate judgments is based upon preconception&amp;ndash;ideas we have formed previously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being at Odds with Life</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2007/08/2007-08-09-being-at-odds-with-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never imagined that I had a monopoly on being at odds with life. It is simply a state of being with which I am much too familiar. I have spent most of my life struggling with things that most people take for granted, stumbling and falling in places where most people stride with confidence and conviction. Strangely, I can dance through other places where most people crawl along blindly in fear and confusion or turn and run from in terror. I am not like everyone else, and I can not just be like everyone else and do what everyone else does. In order to live like other people, I have to learn the role and act the part &amp;ndash; but the performance I put on never ends and by going through the motions I end up not having a life of my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Price of Admission</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a society, what is it made up of and how does it work? The simple answer is, jobs. Society is all about jobs. Living in the wild, surviving on their own, human beings had no jobs. Their lives were defined by the tasks that needed to be done in order to be able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of people living together and sharing their resources does a better job of surviving, and each person becomes primarily responsible for the task he or she is best suited to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

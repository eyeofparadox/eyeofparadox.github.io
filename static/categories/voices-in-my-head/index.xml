      <title>Staring into the Face of Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Price of Dreams</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We never remember the beginning,&amp;rdquo; she said quietly. &amp;ldquo;We pretend not to know why—but then that is one of our favorite tricks, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&amp;rdquo; she glanced up at me, smiling at my confused silence. With her arms crossed she began to drift about the room, examining objects while continuing this strange introduction. &amp;ldquo;We pretend not to know many things. We can even pretend not to know the truth. The horrible truth. But the beginning?&amp;rdquo; she paused and met my eye in the mirror. &amp;ldquo;Well there is an explanation for that one. We never remember the beginning because there never was a beginning. That&amp;rsquo;s one of those horrible parts of the truth we choose to miss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Absolute Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best representation of a thing is the thing itself and yet there are things that we experience great difficulty recognizing in their true form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In speaking of the truth, what we have is a word&amp;ndash;and as a representation of a thing, a word provides a label for a concept that is meaningless without an accurate understanding of what the concept represents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true meaning of truth is a challenge because it calls upon itself for validation, which is a logical fallacy. Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Damage is Done</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what is going to happen next. I wonder if I can hold it together to get a job and move out on my own. I wonder if I can manage to hold on to that job and support myself. I wonder, because I am not really wanted where I am. The only support I can count on, the support of my family and friends, is conditional. It always has been. It has always been conditional on me finding a way to get steady on my own two feet. The irony of that always brings a smile of agony. I know what they want, and that they want it for me, for me to become independent. It is something I do want. The problem is that it leaves me alone inside a life that holds absolutely no meaning for me. This person that I pretend to be, because he means something to his friends and family, means nothing to me. He does not mean enough, to the people who employ him, to have any purpose. He can be replaced by anyone and cannot compete with the living.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A True Identity is Nothing to Fear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response I received to my last post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2008/05/11/conundrum/&#34;&gt;Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;, prompted me to check out the recent posts of the people who commented or posted blogs in the transgender category yesterday. As a result, I became aware of the outcry against the appointment of Dr. Kenneth Zucker, Dr. Ray Blanchard, and J. Michael Bailey, by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), to the work group responsible for revising the entry for Gender Identity Disorder (GID) in the Manual for Diagnosis of Mental Disorders. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/the-apa-appointment-of-zucker-et-al-and-gender-variant-children/&#34;&gt;first blog&lt;/a&gt; I read on the subject, posted by Gender Outlaw, struck a very personal chord with me. In addition to being transgendered, I was put up for adoption when I was four and spent a year in foster care while the state attempted to contact my biological father so that he might claim his custody rights. It was during my time in foster care that I was terrorized out of identifying myself as a girl and learned to keep my true identity a secret. It took time to learn how to restrain my natural impulses and act like a boy, and the threat of abandonment and rejection was used to reinforce &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; behavior. By the time I was adopted, this conditioning had scarred me for life, rendering me incapable of trusting anyone with my true thoughts and feelings. When my new family noticed my feminine traits and confronted me with questions about my behavior, or offered even a mild rebuke for &amp;ldquo;acting like a girl&amp;rdquo; I was consumed with that fear of rejection and lied to deflect any suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the Point?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am back in school, freshly enrolled in the University of Phoenix in pursuit of a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Information Technology&amp;ndash;Visual Communications. I do not have a great deal of time outside of work to devote to this, so I was naturally put out when the site went down in the middle of a post. Not just any post, but a post in which I found myself inspired to posit a somewhat challenging question. Of course that post is now forever lost, inspiring this wonderful missive. When you strive to do not only what is required of you, when you strive to do more than is expected of you and stumble into a thought or question that has real potential, only to have that effort vanish without a trace, does it not make you wonder if there is any point?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Point Paradox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Detailing the dynamics of point paradox has never been easy, but the founding principle is prime awareness, the awareness of one, all and none&amp;quot; she elaborated, settling lightly on the arm of the couch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Point paradox is initially a question of absolutes. An absolute can be represented with a value of ‘one’, ‘zero’ and ‘infinite’. These values are all essentially equal, depending on perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The evolution of the soul begins with the exploration of this prime awareness, which is initially the struggle of one to comprehend the duality of all and none.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Medium of Existence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“A soul is absolute and absolutes are autonomous,” she asserted firmly. “A mind is paradoxical, acting as an inclusive, exclusive and occlusive interface between absolutes, abstractions and manifestations. A mind, with the absolute of a soul as its foundation, is the focus of existence, whether real, surreal or ideal. In short, the mind is the medium of existence, and a single mind can coordinate the disposition of the absolute, the absolutes, and any distillation derived there from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rare and occasional visitor to the eye of paradox will note that I have been absent for the most part from my own blog. Ironically, this is not because I have nothing to say. Quite the opposite; I have too much to say and too little time to spend on writing any of it down. That is my reward for trying to improve my education and hold down a steady job. It underscores the problem of trying to do what is expected of you. I am expected to find my place in the world in spite of the fact that there is no place for me in this world. If you broke me up into bits and pieces, there is some place in the world for each of those parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Touch of Fear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good scare is like good sex. It is gripping and all consuming for an eternal moment, but once it has washed through you and you catch your breath, it evaporates. Like smoke, it unravels, curling in upon itself and expanding into nothing. Before you know it, only the memory remains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

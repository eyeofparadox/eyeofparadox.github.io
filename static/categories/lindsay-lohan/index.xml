      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Lindsay. I don&amp;rsquo;t know you and you certainly do not know me! That said, I do not really expect you to actually read this letter, and if you do, I really do not expect anything from you. Still, it is an open letter &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you, and regardless of who else reads it, it is meant only for &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very clear idea why I am doing this, and if anything actually comes of it, I will probably regret it at some point. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how to begin. I am not your friend. I am not even asking to be your friend &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; you. I appreciate what you have done in your life as an artist more than enough. I do have a kind of selfish interest in you, and honestly it&amp;rsquo;s weird enough to scare you if it is looked at in a certain way. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll run the risk of weirding you out right up front: I probably would have liked being you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

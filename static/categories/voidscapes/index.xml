This is a reworking of one of the first space art cover illustrations I attempted, but never submitted, for Analog. It was created in Photoshop as part of a new series of space art conceived as &amp;ldquo;variations on a theme&amp;rdquo; using similar elements in different ways. In keeping with the role of a concept artist, this series is supposed to demonstrate an ability to create a number of detailed proof images quickly, so each image in this series was produced in an evening or afternoon. The fact that the images all share a common origin and elements also gives them a kind of storyboard quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is actually a pre-visualization done at a smaller scale than I normally work in Photoshop, using small Terragen renders, to help with a work in progress. To those familiar with my Art is Murder gallery as Alexandrea V. Morgan, the planets first appeared on a wallpaper graphic titled &amp;ldquo;Artemis and Athena&amp;rdquo; which was a sneak-preview of the the project I was working on. However, this piece uses the planets in the same orientation they were originally developed, rather than the vertical composition I posted on Art is Murder, to try to keep the lighting of the planets somewhat consistent with the lighting of the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/a-aism-xscape.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/a-aism-xscape.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Above the Horizon&#34; title=&#34;a-aism-xscape&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt to feature some of my artwork here on the eye of paradox. I have always had a strong interest in becoming a professional artist, in spite of having little time and insufficient resources to develop my skills to that level. I started out with the right intentions, pursuing an art degree, but the path I started on led down a different and darker route. I never gave up on the idea, even though it&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time to get to where I am now as an artist and a writer. In the hopes of breaking into publication creating science fiction themed cover art, I became interested in creating voidscapes, images set in outer space. I have learned enough by now to know how much more I have to learn to achieve that goal. I have continued to improve with each work, and I will post some of my more recent efforts or even works in progress as the whim strikes me. Of course, if I get some kind of response to my efforts, the whim might strike more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

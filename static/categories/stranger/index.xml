      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 27, 2008 at 12:36 am, I began a post &amp;ndash; this post, actually &amp;ndash; but got no further than the title. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was because that title summed up my feelings so well that there was no point to writing any further about what was on my mind. Yesterday, those words came back to me at the conclusion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2009/07/06/a-glimpse-into-the-eye-of-paradox/&#34;&gt;A Glimpse into the Eye of Paradox&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of the truth as something that is hidden in plain sight, and approached it as something that we take so much for granted we really don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it. One might as well say that the truth that can be put into words is not the truth. Communication is more a matter of interpretation, and there is no singularity to interpretation. The truth is out there, and every time we encounter it, we are seeing it from a limited point of view. When we come across it again from a different point of view, we still recognize it as the truth but it not only appears different, we ourselves understand it in a different context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Lindsay. I don&amp;rsquo;t know you and you certainly do not know me! That said, I do not really expect you to actually read this letter, and if you do, I really do not expect anything from you. Still, it is an open letter &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you, and regardless of who else reads it, it is meant only for &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very clear idea why I am doing this, and if anything actually comes of it, I will probably regret it at some point. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how to begin. I am not your friend. I am not even asking to be your friend &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; you. I appreciate what you have done in your life as an artist more than enough. I do have a kind of selfish interest in you, and honestly it&amp;rsquo;s weird enough to scare you if it is looked at in a certain way. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll run the risk of weirding you out right up front: I probably would have liked being you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

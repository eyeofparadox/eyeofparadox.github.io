      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Division by Zero and Point Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/strong&gt;: My mind wandered back to division by zero and it suddenly struck me that, if applicable in nature, it would be the point where a value ceases to be &lt;em&gt;quanta&lt;/em&gt; and becomes &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;. I did not see it for a while. I got to it by thinking about what&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight in the concepts of quantum mechanics, and remembering a simple-but-paradoxical description of a hypersphere as &amp;ldquo;a sphere whose surface is nowhere, its focus is everywhere, and its radius infinite&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a thought that just popped into my head after reviewing my last post. Right off the top of my head, I picked out two candidates for the fourth dimension of space; Scale and State.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The underlying principle used to distinguish them was a concept that is spatial in nature, that lies beyond the immediate scope of a volume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, a four dimensional space can theoretically contain an infinite number of volumes, much the way three dimensional space can potentially contain an infinite number of surfaces; what we typically experience as the expression of two dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I sort of choke and swallow hard before posting an article like this on the eye of paradox, in spite of the fact that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;I have a history of being rather candid about my experiences as a &amp;ldquo;transgendered&amp;rdquo; individual here and on deviantart. I know that many of these posts have the potential to hurt me, professionally, and yet they serve the essential and undeniable need for self-expression that is ultimately the only way I can justify my existence. I would not be surprised to find that these posts drive more people away than they ever manage to enlighten, and shade my other writing with a transferred contempt. I am sure many people who do read through them must think, &amp;ldquo;this has to be exaggerated,&amp;rdquo; though I must confess that my best effort to put these feelings into words fall short&amp;ndash;hence, I keep revisiting them, trying to vent the agony in &amp;ldquo;a whisper of hollow words to dress up the shattering, inarticulate screams of a forever breaking heart.&amp;rdquo; If you choose to read this, to know what I cannot allow myself to show on the surface, just know that I overcome this pain in every moment I manage to present that calm, composed facade. I am not looking for pity, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I feel sorry for myself; I am not sorry to be me&amp;ndash;there is just no easy way to present myself to you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Point about Paradox</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the eternal moment, the past and the future are simply a matter of perspective and the past can be influenced by overlapping reinforcement or the intent of the resolving future. A time paradox is a self-informing sequence within a point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The classic grandfather paradox assumes that time is linear, ignoring the fact that the appearance of a person from the future is an unprecedented event at that point in the past. It also ignores the consequences of his absence from the point of his departure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Staring into the Face of Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Impulse</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2009/07/2009-07-25-impulse/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I? Why am I here? What is the point of my existence? These are questions we all ask at some point in our lives, and we can go our entire lives without knowing the answer. I suspect that a lot of people try to avoid thinking about it, not knowing how to begin answering, and I wonder how long a person can go without asking them. There are an endless number of situations and circumstances that can force us to confront these questions, and other soul searching questions like them. For me, the question can come up as a result of gender issues, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had it come up in many other circumstances. The answers, whatever they are, test the limits of my understanding, because in many ways I am the awareness brought into focus by both the sum and the gestalt of my understanding. In the scope of my understanding, I am aware that I am not driven by a desire to be female. I am driven by an impulse that is at once too simple and too complex for words, because words will never serve to express that impulse. Because I found myself in a body that I was not able to express myself properly in, it was only natural for me to become obsessed with finding a better way to express myself. I put a lot of thought and effort into figuring out the best way to embody myself in human terms, and because I was thinking in human terms, my self image is based on understanding the compromises that allowed me to be as true to myself as possible. Of course, human limitations are based on the limitations of reality, which are the perceived limits of existence &amp;ndash; or rather the limits of perception. The plain, simple and painful truth is that I am driven to do something that can not be done within those limits &amp;ndash; as we understand them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These days, it only takes a little curiosity, access to the Internet, and a bit of patience to find explanations of progressive spatial dimensions or examples of four dimensional geometry, such as the old favorite the hyper-square.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the things you will find use analogies like Flatland, or animations which is a way of using time and motion to reveal a higher dimensional object using a lower dimensional cross section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On any given day, a small handful of people find their way to the eye of paradox. Some of them probably just glance at an article to see if it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to the search that brought them here. One or two might actually read something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once in a blue moon, someone leaves a short comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, I do not see anything to indicate that my words mean much. Is that frustrating?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Awakening</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have pointed out before that my struggle with gender dysphoria prompted me to search in all directions for a solution to being born in the wrong body, and the determination with which I pursued that goal in spite of all doubts and discouragements &amp;ndash; even attempts to accept things the way they were, adapting to and adopting the identity imposed on me by circumstances &amp;ndash; says a lot about me, and even about what I ultimately concluded. My existence may be supported by reality, the physical, chemical, biological and sociological fabric out of which we all seem to be spun, but none of these things are me. I exist in my mind and that is why the way I perceive myself in my own mind can not only contradict my physical form, but trump it in importance to my survival. I have heard the theories and arguments on nature versus nurture and taking my own experience into consideration I can say that there are elements in both that can help shape who you are, but only by presenting the options or stimulus necessary for you to determine who you are. I cannot tell you if this is a process of creation or revelation; it feels like both. I am the driving and defining force within my own mind; my mind is the structure and articulation of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A person looking at my blog might get the impression that I do not get much writing done, and it is true that there are a lot of things in my life that get in the way of me writing most of the things I want to. The inside dope is that much of what I do write, I am not sure I want to share. Does anyone not afflicted with gender dysphoria even care about transgender issues? I honestly do not know. I&amp;rsquo;ve known people who were sympathetic, curious, interested, confused, upset and even terrified by the topic. It is an uncomfortable topic, and I do not blame people for not wanting to talk about it; and if no one wants to talk about it (except those of us who have to live with it) why would anyone want to read about it? I dunno, but I do have a lot to say about it, and sometimes I do not realize how much until the words start to spill out. Once they do, I begin to find clarity and focus. It helps me to write it, it helps me to come back and read it, and it has a place here in my blog, because it deals with the paradox of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Divide by Zero</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2008/09/2008-09-18-divide-by-zero/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

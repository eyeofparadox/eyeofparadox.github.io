      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I sort of choke and swallow hard before posting an article like this on the eye of paradox, in spite of the fact that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;I have a history of being rather candid about my experiences as a &amp;ldquo;transgendered&amp;rdquo; individual here and on deviantart. I know that many of these posts have the potential to hurt me, professionally, and yet they serve the essential and undeniable need for self-expression that is ultimately the only way I can justify my existence. I would not be surprised to find that these posts drive more people away than they ever manage to enlighten, and shade my other writing with a transferred contempt. I am sure many people who do read through them must think, &amp;ldquo;this has to be exaggerated,&amp;rdquo; though I must confess that my best effort to put these feelings into words fall short&amp;ndash;hence, I keep revisiting them, trying to vent the agony in &amp;ldquo;a whisper of hollow words to dress up the shattering, inarticulate screams of a forever breaking heart.&amp;rdquo; If you choose to read this, to know what I cannot allow myself to show on the surface, just know that I overcome this pain in every moment I manage to present that calm, composed facade. I am not looking for pity, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I feel sorry for myself; I am not sorry to be me&amp;ndash;there is just no easy way to present myself to you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Point Penetrating Points Overlapping</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of my posts, particularly the ones dealing with transgender issues in my life, have been written on a long, dark night of the soul. It can be difficult to come back and read what I&amp;rsquo;ve posted and resist the urge to delete what I&amp;rsquo;ve written, because of how dark they are. I have moments when I think, if ever a family member happened to read them, some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve written could really hurt them. That was never the intention, and yet, there is a ring of truth to the posts I am not able to deny. It is an unfortunate fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurt a great deal by people who never meant me harm because of things neither I nor they had any control over. It is not their fault that efforts to encourage my growth and development as a son or brother caused me so much pain; they were simply responding to what they perceived me to be. Our current society is the end product of thousands of generations of people struggling through life trying to make sense out of it. If that resulted in the division of human traits into masculine and feminine, and if the cultivation of gender roles led to a society that could not understand that there was a difference between the things that make people who they are and the things that make them what they are, it is not possible to assign fault or blame to any specific group, let alone a given person. As much as it would have made a difference in my life to have been raised among people who were more perceptive, or in a society that was more accepting of individual differences, I would still have grown up with the more difficult problem of being a girl in a boy&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It is Where You Can, and Yet... CAN You? On Writing What I Know.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I may have commented on it in passing, and it is something I certainly never miss, but my art and writing have always brought out the real me. In a sense, that is appropriate enough; isn&amp;rsquo;t it a common recommendation that writers draw from their own experiences? I often feel that my escape into fantasy or science fiction has been good for my sanity, but bad for my hopes of a writing career. I could be wrong. I see enough gender bending in books, manga and film. I find it interesting that most cases involve a boy turned into a girl against his will. Interestingly enough, the first time I picked up an issue of Ranma 1/2, I put it back when I discovered that Ranma considered his ability to become a girl a curse. I did not think I could stomach reading about a guy hated having what I so desperately longed for. Months later, I gave Ranma 1/2 a second chance and eventually came to like him and appreciate what he was going through. I became a fan, read all the manga, watched as much of the anime as I could stand (if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried, you know why I say that), and even wrote over a million words of fan fiction. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to complete volume five; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to give it my attention when I am struggling to hold myself together and it&amp;rsquo;s writing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Recapitulation &amp;amp; Reflection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A person looking at my blog might get the impression that I do not get much writing done, and it is true that there are a lot of things in my life that get in the way of me writing most of the things I want to. The inside dope is that much of what I do write, I am not sure I want to share. Does anyone not afflicted with gender dysphoria even care about transgender issues? I honestly do not know. I&amp;rsquo;ve known people who were sympathetic, curious, interested, confused, upset and even terrified by the topic. It is an uncomfortable topic, and I do not blame people for not wanting to talk about it; and if no one wants to talk about it (except those of us who have to live with it) why would anyone want to read about it? I dunno, but I do have a lot to say about it, and sometimes I do not realize how much until the words start to spill out. Once they do, I begin to find clarity and focus. It helps me to write it, it helps me to come back and read it, and it has a place here in my blog, because it deals with the paradox of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A True Identity is Nothing to Fear</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The response I received to my last post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2008/05/11/conundrum/&#34;&gt;Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;, prompted me to check out the recent posts of the people who commented or posted blogs in the transgender category yesterday. As a result, I became aware of the outcry against the appointment of Dr. Kenneth Zucker, Dr. Ray Blanchard, and J. Michael Bailey, by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), to the work group responsible for revising the entry for Gender Identity Disorder (GID) in the Manual for Diagnosis of Mental Disorders. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/the-apa-appointment-of-zucker-et-al-and-gender-variant-children/&#34;&gt;first blog&lt;/a&gt; I read on the subject, posted by Gender Outlaw, struck a very personal chord with me. In addition to being transgendered, I was put up for adoption when I was four and spent a year in foster care while the state attempted to contact my biological father so that he might claim his custody rights. It was during my time in foster care that I was terrorized out of identifying myself as a girl and learned to keep my true identity a secret. It took time to learn how to restrain my natural impulses and act like a boy, and the threat of abandonment and rejection was used to reinforce &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; behavior. By the time I was adopted, this conditioning had scarred me for life, rendering me incapable of trusting anyone with my true thoughts and feelings. When my new family noticed my feminine traits and confronted me with questions about my behavior, or offered even a mild rebuke for &amp;ldquo;acting like a girl&amp;rdquo; I was consumed with that fear of rejection and lied to deflect any suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being at Odds with Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I never imagined that I had a monopoly on being at odds with life. It is simply a state of being with which I am much too familiar. I have spent most of my life struggling with things that most people take for granted, stumbling and falling in places where most people stride with confidence and conviction. Strangely, I can dance through other places where most people crawl along blindly in fear and confusion or turn and run from in terror. I am not like everyone else, and I can not just be like everyone else and do what everyone else does. In order to live like other people, I have to learn the role and act the part &amp;ndash; but the performance I put on never ends and by going through the motions I end up not having a life of my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GID?</title>
      <link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/07/2007-07-20-gid/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my bio on Helium, I confided a history of GID. That is Gender Identity Disorder, for those of you who did not know. There are a number of problems with that particular label for a condition that is poorly understood at best and entirely subjective at worst. Other terms that can be used are Gender Dysphoria or Transgendered, and like GID, there are issues inherent in their use as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

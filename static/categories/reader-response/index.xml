      <title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gravity in a Distributed, Process Driven, Information-Based Universe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes. Today, we have the advantage of having had great minds ponder the mystery and define what can be observed and inferred by studying it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Newton pondered the question &amp;ldquo;why do objects fall?&amp;rdquo; and provided us with a theory of universal gravity (along with his three laws of motion). He essentially defined the terms we now use to describe and quantify gravity, the force that attracts objects with mass to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explaining the Different Dimensions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally avoid the first person when writing an article or essay, but in this case I need to begin with a personal story&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year into my studies at Humboldt State University a mutual acquaintance showed up at my friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment while I was visiting and regaled us with his synopsis of a lecture on dimensions he recently attended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not recall what the class was, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I remember the student&amp;rsquo;s name, but I will never forget that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is there really such a thing as the present?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there really such a thing as time? That is a question it is helpful to ask in order to address what we call the present. That is because our experience of time is completely subjective and because everything we are is dependent on that peculiar subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is what we derive from the ceaseless transformation that is part of awareness, consciousness, thought, perception, action and reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is our measure of the dynamic quality of existence that compliments the static quality of existence the latter of which allows the world and ourselves to be manifest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Noosphere: The Future of Evolution?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those moments in life when we are confronted with a new concept or idea can be life altering, seemingly setting the mind free to roam a new and undiscovered country or even knocking the world completely off its hinges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that can happen even with just a new word or concept for something we&amp;rsquo;ve had an inkling of all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it is more like getting hit in the head with a brick and realizing that this strange and wonderous idea has been staring us in the face for so long we have actually gotten in the habit of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Readers from Helium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the features not provided for contributors on the now-defunct Helium writer&amp;rsquo;s website was a way for readers to respond directly to the writers. While it was active, the only way for readers to respond on Helium was by posting their own thoughts on the topic at hand. Those who were so inclined were welcome to do so, there, but I imagined that not all responses would have been suited to that approach, so I invited my readers to respond here if they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Implications of the Mind in Matter: The Prospect of Oblivion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on Helium under: &lt;strong&gt;The fundamentals of self-awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mind is an inherently fascinating and difficult subject to pin down. Philosophers have been musing over the mysteries of the mind for thousands of years but it is, without doubt, the scientists who find it the most frustrating to study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subjective nature of the mind makes it ill suited for scientific scrutiny, but scientists have found ways to pursue the matter indirectly. While some scientists have probed the frontier of the mind through behavioral psychology, others have focused their attention on the body and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Purpose of Religion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2007/07/2007-07-18-the-purpose-of-religion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In asking about the purpose of religion, it is necessary to ask first if religion is not simply a product of our own search for purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the primary question depends on whether we perceive religion as having a divine origin or if we see it as the origin of divine thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, religion comes to us through human agents, so we have to begin by looking at what it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just stumbled across a few things I wrote for a creative writing class I took this past spring to fulfill an elective requirement. One of the assignments involved writing a short story based on a work of art found online. I had no trouble thinking of one that sparked my imagination. The painting &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://kyena.deviantart.com/art/Summer-comes-30814005&#34;&gt;Summer Comes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; by Kyena was posted on DeviantArt on March 24, 2006, receiving special notice on April 12, 2006 as a &amp;ldquo;Daily Deviation&amp;rdquo; or a featured artwork on the popular artists&amp;rsquo; community site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Lindsay. I don&amp;rsquo;t know you and you certainly do not know me! That said, I do not really expect you to actually read this letter, and if you do, I really do not expect anything from you. Still, it is an open letter &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; you, and regardless of who else reads it, it is meant only for &lt;em&gt;you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a very clear idea why I am doing this, and if anything actually comes of it, I will probably regret it at some point. I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure how to begin. I am not your friend. I am not even asking to be your friend &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t want anything &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; you. I appreciate what you have done in your life as an artist more than enough. I do have a kind of selfish interest in you, and honestly it&amp;rsquo;s weird enough to scare you if it is looked at in a certain way. So, I&amp;rsquo;ll run the risk of weirding you out right up front: I probably would have liked being you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

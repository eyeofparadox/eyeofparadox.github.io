      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advisory:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I sort of choke and swallow hard before posting an article like this on the eye of paradox, in spite of the fact that&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;I have a history of being rather candid about my experiences as a &amp;ldquo;transgendered&amp;rdquo; individual here and on deviantart. I know that many of these posts have the potential to hurt me, professionally, and yet they serve the essential and undeniable need for self-expression that is ultimately the only way I can justify my existence. I would not be surprised to find that these posts drive more people away than they ever manage to enlighten, and shade my other writing with a transferred contempt. I am sure many people who do read through them must think, &amp;ldquo;this has to be exaggerated,&amp;rdquo; though I must confess that my best effort to put these feelings into words fall short&amp;ndash;hence, I keep revisiting them, trying to vent the agony in &amp;ldquo;a whisper of hollow words to dress up the shattering, inarticulate screams of a forever breaking heart.&amp;rdquo; If you choose to read this, to know what I cannot allow myself to show on the surface, just know that I overcome this pain in every moment I manage to present that calm, composed facade. I am not looking for pity, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I feel sorry for myself; I am not sorry to be me&amp;ndash;there is just no easy way to present myself to you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have always had a knack for art, an urge to write and a flair for dramatics, so I always expected to end up as an artist, author or actor. I even got an early taste of college the summer after my freshman year in High School, on a 3/4 summer scholarship to the Academy of Art in San Francisco. That experience taught me that talent has to be backed up by hard work and sacrifice. I was not a perfect 4.0 student, but I was the first in the family to go off to college. I longed to go to a real art school, and was even offered a modest scholarship to the Savannah College of Art and Design&amp;ndash;but my parents could really only afford to send me to a State University. I learned that Humboldt State had a good Drama program and&amp;ndash;confident my own talent would carry me through any Art program at the state level&amp;ndash;I chose HSU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” The one that holds the most truth, however, is, “Life isn’t fair, Princess. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell something.” What is true about life is true about work. I have never objected to working for a living, but as often as not I’ve found myself in a situation where I was living only to work. I’m an artist and a writer, so I am constantly driven to create—but I’ve rarely been lucky enough to get paid for my art or writing. So, I usually had a full time job, or two or three part time or contract jobs just to pay the bills. I would spend eight hours at work, as much as 3 hours communing to and from work, and another eight hours working on projects at home. I would get a few hours of sleep, and do it all again the next day, squeezing meals in when I had half an hour to spare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poetry and Figurative Language Paper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 6, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENG 340 - Creative Writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Shari Muench, EdD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pen and a piece of paper might technically be the only “tools” a poet requires, but there are many “literary” tools at his (or her) disposal as well. In addition to imagination and a little flirtation with the Muse, a poet uses many other elements of writing to craft his (or her) messages to the heart and soul. This paper looks at the works of three great poets, three extraordinary poems, and explores the imagery, metaphors, rhyme and structure that make them so great. Examples from William Shakespeare’s sonnet, “When, in Disgrace with Fortune and Men’s Eyes” (Thiel, 2004, p.311), Robert Frost’s “The Road Not Taken” (Thiel, 2004, p.297), and Craig Raine’s, “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” (Thiel, 2004, p.308) will be used to discuss the importance of figurative language in poetry and how it communicates to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hidden in Plain Sight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On April 27, 2008 at 12:36 am, I began a post &amp;ndash; this post, actually &amp;ndash; but got no further than the title. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was because that title summed up my feelings so well that there was no point to writing any further about what was on my mind. Yesterday, those words came back to me at the conclusion of &lt;a href=&#34;http://eyeofparadox.com/2009/07/06/a-glimpse-into-the-eye-of-paradox/&#34;&gt;A Glimpse into the Eye of Paradox&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of the truth as something that is hidden in plain sight, and approached it as something that we take so much for granted we really don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with it. One might as well say that the truth that can be put into words is not the truth. Communication is more a matter of interpretation, and there is no singularity to interpretation. The truth is out there, and every time we encounter it, we are seeing it from a limited point of view. When we come across it again from a different point of view, we still recognize it as the truth but it not only appears different, we ourselves understand it in a different context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Slightly Left of Nowhere</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely have time to write or draw, and as my friend keeps reminding me, I&amp;rsquo;ve little hope making a living as an artist or writer. I have to agree, knowing that even brilliant writing and art takes a massive investment of time and effort up front. That seems to be a recurring theme in my life, however. I have never really had the things I needed to succeed in life. I have almost always had a reasonable substitute for the things I lack, which I am sure could have been used to achieve success, if success meant anything in the absence of a life worth living. The hard, cold facts of life undermine my identity and force me to live the life of a person that does not exist. I succeeded in earning enough to live and function as a man, but the process left me with no sense of myself as a person; nothing that I did felt real to me and nothing that I engaged in felt meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It is Where You Can, and Yet... CAN You? On Writing What I Know.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I may have commented on it in passing, and it is something I certainly never miss, but my art and writing have always brought out the real me. In a sense, that is appropriate enough; isn&amp;rsquo;t it a common recommendation that writers draw from their own experiences? I often feel that my escape into fantasy or science fiction has been good for my sanity, but bad for my hopes of a writing career. I could be wrong. I see enough gender bending in books, manga and film. I find it interesting that most cases involve a boy turned into a girl against his will. Interestingly enough, the first time I picked up an issue of Ranma 1/2, I put it back when I discovered that Ranma considered his ability to become a girl a curse. I did not think I could stomach reading about a guy hated having what I so desperately longed for. Months later, I gave Ranma 1/2 a second chance and eventually came to like him and appreciate what he was going through. I became a fan, read all the manga, watched as much of the anime as I could stand (if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried, you know why I say that), and even wrote over a million words of fan fiction. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to complete volume five; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to give it my attention when I am struggling to hold myself together and it&amp;rsquo;s writing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been scratching out ideas since the writing bug first bit me in grade school. Somewhere in the back of my mind I always had this notion that I was going to devote some part of my life to writing. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent much more time thinking, while trying to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; time to get anything written! Inevitably, when the time came to start writing, I had thoughts waiting to be expressed. I used to just spill them out in a notepad and file them away, but having tripped over a link to Helium a few months ago (AN: this was back in 2007; the site is long gone now), I found a more interesting place to put them. After publishing my tenth article, I got an itch for something more. I wanted to be able to continue to explore the ideas that bit me, and that really calls for something more like a blog. So, even though I will (or at least intended to, at the time) continue to publish articles on Helium, I am also going to be exploring some of them here in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Readers from Helium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the features not provided for contributors on the now-defunct Helium writer&amp;rsquo;s website was a way for readers to respond directly to the writers. While it was active, the only way for readers to respond on Helium was by posting their own thoughts on the topic at hand. Those who were so inclined were welcome to do so, there, but I imagined that not all responses would have been suited to that approach, so I invited my readers to respond here if they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

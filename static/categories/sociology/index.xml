      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all human. None of us have a say in what circumstances we are born. Pretty much any other characteristic by which people can be defined produces some form of social stratification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with the ideas of caste and class, and tried to understand how anyone can willingly accept being &amp;ldquo;put in their place&amp;rdquo; by the people around them. In the end, I think it all comes down to the perception of power, the ways in which circumstances can be used to dominate society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grouping is an activity that comes instinctively and automatically to people. It is part of a filtering process that allows us to make sense of our universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anything can serve as criteria for grouping, but because this is a perceptual-interpretive process; differences and similarities in physical characteristics are the most prevalent. As we learn and grow, we also associate ideas and experiences with the items in our cognitive inventory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We give values to people, places and things based on personal experience, inherited attitudes and beliefs, and assumptions. Part of our ability to form instant impressions and make immediate judgments is based upon preconception&amp;ndash;ideas we have formed previously.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is a society, what is it made up of and how does it work? The simple answer is, jobs. Society is all about jobs. Living in the wild, surviving on their own, human beings had no jobs. Their lives were defined by the tasks that needed to be done in order to be able to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of people living together and sharing their resources does a better job of surviving, and each person becomes primarily responsible for the task he or she is best suited to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

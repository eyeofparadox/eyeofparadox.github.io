      <title>The Absolute Truth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best representation of a thing is the thing itself and yet there are things that we experience great difficulty recognizing in their true form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In speaking of the truth, what we have is a word&amp;ndash;and as a representation of a thing, a word provides a label for a concept that is meaningless without an accurate understanding of what the concept represents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true meaning of truth is a challenge because it calls upon itself for validation, which is a logical fallacy. Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Divide by Zero</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gravity in a Distributed, Process Driven, Information-Based Universe</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes. Today, we have the advantage of having had great minds ponder the mystery and define what can be observed and inferred by studying it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Newton pondered the question &amp;ldquo;why do objects fall?&amp;rdquo; and provided us with a theory of universal gravity (along with his three laws of motion). He essentially defined the terms we now use to describe and quantify gravity, the force that attracts objects with mass to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is evil?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a line in &amp;ldquo;The Matrix&amp;rdquo; when Morpheus confronts Neo about a wrongness in the world, &amp;ldquo;like a splinter in your mind.&amp;rdquo;  It was caused by an instinctive apprehension of the artificial reality he was trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is similar to a feeling many people have about our own reality. There is a wrongness in the world, evident in the mystery of life, the inevitability of death and in the things that we call evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally avoid the first person when writing an article or essay, but in this case I need to begin with a personal story&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year into my studies at Humboldt State University a mutual acquaintance showed up at my friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment while I was visiting and regaled us with his synopsis of a lecture on dimensions he recently attended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not recall what the class was, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I remember the student&amp;rsquo;s name, but I will never forget that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been scratching out ideas since the writing bug first bit me in grade school. Somewhere in the back of my mind I always had this notion that I was going to devote some part of my life to writing. Of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent much more time thinking, while trying to &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; time to get anything written! Inevitably, when the time came to start writing, I had thoughts waiting to be expressed. I used to just spill them out in a notepad and file them away, but having tripped over a link to Helium a few months ago (AN: this was back in 2007; the site is long gone now), I found a more interesting place to put them. After publishing my tenth article, I got an itch for something more. I wanted to be able to continue to explore the ideas that bit me, and that really calls for something more like a blog. So, even though I will (or at least intended to, at the time) continue to publish articles on Helium, I am also going to be exploring some of them here in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is there really such a thing as the present?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there really such a thing as time? That is a question it is helpful to ask in order to address what we call the present. That is because our experience of time is completely subjective and because everything we are is dependent on that peculiar subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is what we derive from the ceaseless transformation that is part of awareness, consciousness, thought, perception, action and reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is our measure of the dynamic quality of existence that compliments the static quality of existence the latter of which allows the world and ourselves to be manifest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Noosphere: The Future of Evolution?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those moments in life when we are confronted with a new concept or idea can be life altering, seemingly setting the mind free to roam a new and undiscovered country or even knocking the world completely off its hinges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that can happen even with just a new word or concept for something we&amp;rsquo;ve had an inkling of all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it is more like getting hit in the head with a brick and realizing that this strange and wonderous idea has been staring us in the face for so long we have actually gotten in the habit of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Readers from Helium</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the features not provided for contributors on the now-defunct Helium writer&amp;rsquo;s website was a way for readers to respond directly to the writers. While it was active, the only way for readers to respond on Helium was by posting their own thoughts on the topic at hand. Those who were so inclined were welcome to do so, there, but I imagined that not all responses would have been suited to that approach, so I invited my readers to respond here if they preferred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on Helium under: &lt;strong&gt;The fundamentals of self-awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mind is an inherently fascinating and difficult subject to pin down. Philosophers have been musing over the mysteries of the mind for thousands of years but it is, without doubt, the scientists who find it the most frustrating to study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subjective nature of the mind makes it ill suited for scientific scrutiny, but scientists have found ways to pursue the matter indirectly. While some scientists have probed the frontier of the mind through behavioral psychology, others have focused their attention on the body and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Purpose of Religion</title>
      <link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/07/2007-07-18-the-purpose-of-religion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In asking about the purpose of religion, it is necessary to ask first if religion is not simply a product of our own search for purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the primary question depends on whether we perceive religion as having a divine origin or if we see it as the origin of divine thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, religion comes to us through human agents, so we have to begin by looking at what it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

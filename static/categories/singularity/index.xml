      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Division by Zero and Point Paradox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/strong&gt;: My mind wandered back to division by zero and it suddenly struck me that, if applicable in nature, it would be the point where a value ceases to be &lt;em&gt;quanta&lt;/em&gt; and becomes &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;. I did not see it for a while. I got to it by thinking about what&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight in the concepts of quantum mechanics, and remembering a simple-but-paradoxical description of a hypersphere as &amp;ldquo;a sphere whose surface is nowhere, its focus is everywhere, and its radius infinite&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I stumble across a question I have to stop and ask, but I am usually in the middle of something that needs to be done. So, I put it off for later, often forgetting to even write the question down. I know this one is going to come back to plague me, so I am putting it out there in the hopes I can come back and do some research on it later, while giving the random visitor to my site a chance to comment on it or point me toward a source with something to say about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you divide by nothing, in one sense, you get nothing. In another sense, you are left with everything. However much there is to divide, all of it remains - undivided. The remainder is everything. To count it all, however, you must divide it up into discrete quantities. Of course, you can keep dividing it into smaller and smaller parts, each of which is increasingly infinitesimal. As you do so, the number you are calculating approaches infinity. This is the paradox of division by zero.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have always had a knack for art, an urge to write and a flair for dramatics, so I always expected to end up as an artist, author or actor. I even got an early taste of college the summer after my freshman year in High School, on a 3/4 summer scholarship to the Academy of Art in San Francisco. That experience taught me that talent has to be backed up by hard work and sacrifice. I was not a perfect 4.0 student, but I was the first in the family to go off to college. I longed to go to a real art school, and was even offered a modest scholarship to the Savannah College of Art and Design&amp;ndash;but my parents could really only afford to send me to a State University. I learned that Humboldt State had a good Drama program and&amp;ndash;confident my own talent would carry me through any Art program at the state level&amp;ndash;I chose HSU.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original publication: December 7, 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re: University of Phoenix Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associate of Arts in Business&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bachelor of Science in Information Technology for Visual Communications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h5 id=&#34;article-1---100-words-answering-the-question&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article #1 - 100 words answering the question:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-your-pay-fair&#34;&gt;Is your pay fair?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fair-but-not-very-fair&#34;&gt;Fair, But Not &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; Fair&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of great lines in “The Princess Bride” like “Never go up against a Sicilian when Death is on the line” or “Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” The one that holds the most truth, however, is, “Life isn’t fair, Princess. Anyone who says otherwise is trying to sell something.” What is true about life is true about work. I have never objected to working for a living, but as often as not I’ve found myself in a situation where I was living only to work. I’m an artist and a writer, so I am constantly driven to create—but I’ve rarely been lucky enough to get paid for my art or writing. So, I usually had a full time job, or two or three part time or contract jobs just to pay the bills. I would spend eight hours at work, as much as 3 hours communing to and from work, and another eight hours working on projects at home. I would get a few hours of sleep, and do it all again the next day, squeezing meals in when I had half an hour to spare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poetry and Figurative Language Paper</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 6, 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENG 340 - Creative Writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Shari Muench, EdD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A pen and a piece of paper might technically be the only “tools” a poet requires, but there are many “literary” tools at his (or her) disposal as well. In addition to imagination and a little flirtation with the Muse, a poet uses many other elements of writing to craft his (or her) messages to the heart and soul. This paper looks at the works of three great poets, three extraordinary poems, and explores the imagery, metaphors, rhyme and structure that make them so great. Examples from William Shakespeare’s sonnet, “When, in Disgrace with Fortune and Men’s Eyes” (Thiel, 2004, p.311), Robert Frost’s “The Road Not Taken” (Thiel, 2004, p.297), and Craig Raine’s, “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” (Thiel, 2004, p.308) will be used to discuss the importance of figurative language in poetry and how it communicates to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Absolute Truth</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2008/10/2008-10-03-the-absolute-truth/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best representation of a thing is the thing itself and yet there are things that we experience great difficulty recognizing in their true form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In speaking of the truth, what we have is a word&amp;ndash;and as a representation of a thing, a word provides a label for a concept that is meaningless without an accurate understanding of what the concept represents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true meaning of truth is a challenge because it calls upon itself for validation, which is a logical fallacy. Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Divide by Zero</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2008/09/2008-09-18-divide-by-zero/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes. Today, we have the advantage of having had great minds ponder the mystery and define what can be observed and inferred by studying it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Newton pondered the question &amp;ldquo;why do objects fall?&amp;rdquo; and provided us with a theory of universal gravity (along with his three laws of motion). He essentially defined the terms we now use to describe and quantify gravity, the force that attracts objects with mass to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a line in &amp;ldquo;The Matrix&amp;rdquo; when Morpheus confronts Neo about a wrongness in the world, &amp;ldquo;like a splinter in your mind.&amp;rdquo;  It was caused by an instinctive apprehension of the artificial reality he was trapped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is similar to a feeling many people have about our own reality. There is a wrongness in the world, evident in the mystery of life, the inevitability of death and in the things that we call evil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I normally avoid the first person when writing an article or essay, but in this case I need to begin with a personal story&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year into my studies at Humboldt State University a mutual acquaintance showed up at my friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment while I was visiting and regaled us with his synopsis of a lecture on dimensions he recently attended.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not recall what the class was, and I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I remember the student&amp;rsquo;s name, but I will never forget that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is there really such a thing as the present?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is there really such a thing as time? That is a question it is helpful to ask in order to address what we call the present. That is because our experience of time is completely subjective and because everything we are is dependent on that peculiar subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is what we derive from the ceaseless transformation that is part of awareness, consciousness, thought, perception, action and reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time is our measure of the dynamic quality of existence that compliments the static quality of existence the latter of which allows the world and ourselves to be manifest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those moments in life when we are confronted with a new concept or idea can be life altering, seemingly setting the mind free to roam a new and undiscovered country or even knocking the world completely off its hinges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes that can happen even with just a new word or concept for something we&amp;rsquo;ve had an inkling of all along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, it is more like getting hit in the head with a brick and realizing that this strange and wonderous idea has been staring us in the face for so long we have actually gotten in the habit of ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Posted on Helium under: &lt;strong&gt;The fundamentals of self-awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mind is an inherently fascinating and difficult subject to pin down. Philosophers have been musing over the mysteries of the mind for thousands of years but it is, without doubt, the scientists who find it the most frustrating to study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The subjective nature of the mind makes it ill suited for scientific scrutiny, but scientists have found ways to pursue the matter indirectly. While some scientists have probed the frontier of the mind through behavioral psychology, others have focused their attention on the body and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Purpose of Religion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2007/07/2007-07-18-the-purpose-of-religion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In asking about the purpose of religion, it is necessary to ask first if religion is not simply a product of our own search for purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer to the primary question depends on whether we perceive religion as having a divine origin or if we see it as the origin of divine thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either way, religion comes to us through human agents, so we have to begin by looking at what it is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

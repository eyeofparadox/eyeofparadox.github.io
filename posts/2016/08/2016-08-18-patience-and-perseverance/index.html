<hr>
<p>I know that there&rsquo;s too much activity for anyone to keep up with the journals (or blogs) of everyone they follow. That is one of the reasons I do not treat my dA journal (or the eye of paradox) as a place to vent anymore. As nice as it can be to vent on occasion, it&rsquo;s not the most productive way to spend your time. I&rsquo;ve done the same on my blog. I have let both hang in limbo while I focused on improving my education, practicing my skills and working or looking for work. The looking for work part ended up being quite a job, and for a moment there I was worried it would not pay off. Fortunately, patience and perseverance has.</p>
<p>I have accepted a job offer for a UI Developer position starting on Monday (this was back in 2014, don&rsquo;t forget), and have also set up an illustration/design contract I will be finalizing on Saturday. In the past five months, I have established an online Prosite portfolio (sadly, now defunct but replaced by my current <a href="https://davidbryanroberson.artstation.com/">portfolio</a>) and profiles on key sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Behance. I&rsquo;ve made huge strides forward in adding 3D Illustration to my skillset, and have acquired the tools to begin modeling and animating in 3D as well. I will need to wait to upgrade my hardware to support intense rendering, and to make the upgrade to Adobe CS6.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the new business model Adobe has taken with Creative Cloud. I&rsquo;m not excited to pay premium licensing fees only to have a mandatory subscription service that allows Adobe to deactivate the software remotely. While work is available, it&rsquo;s not hard to keep up with the subscription, but in a tough job market, it&rsquo;s possible to end up with a long dry spell in which recurring expenses become difficult to maintain. I would hate to lose the tools I need to find employment at a time like that. So, I will have to keep CS5 on a back up system and maintain a separate license for CS6.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s only a minor hiccup. I prefer to focus on moving forward, so that I have better options if faced with another dry spell. I have just completed work on a novella, published here and on FictionPress as The Price of Dreams. The story is an introduction to an epic I&rsquo;ve been working on in the background for decades, and serves as both a prologue and epilogue. It is a very philosophical, arguably metaphysical, piece of fiction&ndash;mind-bending to say the least. It refers to concepts that the larger epic would have more room to address.</p>
<p>It also touches on my involvement as the creative force and personality behind the project, introducing a character confronted with the fact of her existence as a character not only in the story, but as the reason for her entire universe&rsquo;s existence. So, this is a character who was forced to endure paradox, confronting power and the prospect of goddess-hood only to discover she was a part of me&ndash;a way for me to escape my own reality. Finding her existence tied to mine, subject to the limits of my reality, she demands to have her story told.</p>
<p>I am publishing this online to give people a chance to comment on, or encourage me to write, her&ndash;or should I say, our?&ndash;story. I may make this available in e-book form as a fund raising scheme. The individual chapters are available as Premium Content downloads; the points would mostly go towards upgrading to a premium account and advertising on dA. So, it&rsquo;s a minor way to make donations to show your support. Of course, I would really like to hear people&rsquo;s thoughts, so I hope you will take the time to share them. I also urge you to read it all the way through.</p>
<p>From the visitor stats, it seems like people are stumbling onto the chapters in random order. The story is confusing enough when you&rsquo;re following it. It must be absolutely confounding to jump into at random!</p>
<p>In any case, I will be busy with paying work for a while, so new posts may slack off for a month of so. If you leave comments, but do not get replies right away, that just means I&rsquo;m tied up with work. I will try to catch up whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>As always, my thanks to everyone who finds something in my gallery (or blog) worthy of making a favorite (or comment, follow, etc.) or addition to one of their collections. I want to thank in advance everyone who takes the time to look through my artwork or read some of my writing.</p>

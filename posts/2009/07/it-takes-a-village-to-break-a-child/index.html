truth</a></div></div></div><div class="Box-body px-5 pb-5" style=z-index:1><article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg"><p>I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &ldquo;cisgendered&rdquo; if I use the term that&rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.</p><p>Because I was being held to a standard of behavior I truly did not understand and which did not come naturally to me, I had no choice but to conceal my pain and confusion in order to conform to that standard. As I&rsquo;ve said before, it had been made clear to me that my &ldquo;disobedience&rdquo; was justification for punishment, rejection and abandonment, so it did not take long before I was conditioned to assume that anyone who enforced the male standard of behavior could not be trusted. I could not ask anyone why it hurt so much to not be a girl or why nothing about being a boy made me happy. I could never understand why compliments and praises highlighting my qualities or accomplishments as a boy left me feeling hurt, hollow and unhappy. I did at least feel relief and gratitude for the fact that it made people happy with me, and at the time I thought that was what happiness was. I was not always caught on the double-edged sword of gender conflict. No one can be, because one thing that Sophia Marsden pointed out is true; life is full of things that can be appreciated no matter who or what you are. In fact, I pretty much lived for those things, using them to distract myself, and in my preoccupation I pretty much forgot myself and acted like a girl &ndash; perhaps a tomboy, I should say, since I managed to get away with it more often than not. If there is a bright side to my childhood, it was that I found ways to be as much like a boy or a girl as I wanted to, as long as no adults were observing me. Unfortunately, I was never comfortable with my genitalia, or the fact that the sensitive organ served as a constant reminder of why I was not a girl. It pissed me off that I was never allowed to let my hair grow, and I hated the clothes I was forced to wear.</p><p>The simple fact is, there was always something bringing the gender conflict to the fore. No matter how hard I tried to be obedient, practical and realistic, the notion of myself as a boy never took hold. I was always caught off guard by the realization that I was male, and even when I was trying my hardest to keep that fact in mind, I would look at the girls around me with admiration and envy, forever underscored with an ache of loss. I did not really wonder why, because I knew why I felt this way, and knew it was forbidden, so I simply did not allow myself to think of it most of the time. I just locked myself away and died a little more each day. In a sense, when I got my hands on an anatomy book and finally found out why I was not a girl, I understood what was expected of me. I still did not know why I felt like a girl, and I still do not know. I do not know why I feel like I am lying whenever I act like a man. It is a feeling that makes me feel so sick, I cannot even get past the stupid &ldquo;male or female&rdquo; check-box on a job application. I mean, if you look at me and assume I&rsquo;m just another guy, then, well, whatever, I cannot blame you for what you see, but if you ask me, I no longer know what to say. I am no longer a child to be threatened with abandonment, I am no longer willing to give anyone the power to reject me. I am more than willing to do any job asked of me, but I am no longer able to ask for a job, and if I care even an ounce for my own well-being, I cannot say anyone can pay me enough to endure what I have to do to myself in order to work. I got into temping and contracting because, for the most part, I am never in a position to ask for work, I am asked for; unfortunately, even that is drying up, and once my savings run out, I&rsquo;ll be stuck homeless in Alaska with winter around the corner. The scary thing is, that doesn&rsquo;t frighten me. I&rsquo;m long past the point where I can be motivated by fear. Or, I am more afraid of compromising myself ever again.</p><p>I do not want to die, and I do not want to quit, but I do not trust anyone, I know I do not fit in, and even though there are people who understand and care, I know they have to take care of themselves first. I have made little appeals for anonymous help because I know I need it, and since I do not really expect anything to come of it, I really feel no guilt for asking. When you hurt enough, you scream. It&rsquo;s human nature. Walking by and pretending not to hear the screaming is too. I really have no idea what I would have done if anyone had stopped and asked what was wrong. I would really be at a loss if someone thought they could help and offered. If someone wanted to throw money at me, no strings attached, I&rsquo;d take advantage of it; it would be stupid not to and even if I&rsquo;ve lost the will to go on living like this, I&rsquo;m still too stubborn to die. I go through these spells of crying for help unable to decide for myself if they&rsquo;re the remnants of my morbid sense of humor, a way to make it clear that I can manage a cry for help without killing myself, or simply an example of believing in people even if I am no longer able to trust anyone. In the end, the reason I write is not in the hope of salvation, but in the hope of understanding the answers to questions I do not even know how to ask. The people who shaped my childhood did not understand me, and their actions hurt me because they were carried out by kind and caring people I depended on. I could not tell you who is responsible for breaking my spirit, or failing to simply ask &ldquo;why does this boy think he&rsquo;s a girl?&rdquo; My father stepped out of the picture when I was three, my mother&rsquo;s parents convinced her to put me up for adoption when I was four, I was passed around between extended family members and foster care like a hot potato. Someone, perhaps more than one, saw my natural personality as a problem and whatever they did, the damage was done by the time I found myself in a safe and stable environment. I guess that just means that sometimes it takes a village to break a child.</p></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><script type=application/javascript src=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/js/toc.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/css/toc.css></div><div class="footer container-xl width-full p-responsive"><div class="position-relative d-flex flex-row-reverse flex-lg-row flex-wrap flex-lg-nowrap flex-justify-center flex-lg-justify-between flex-sm-items-center pt-6 pb-2 mt-6 f6 text-gray border-top border-gray-light"><a aria-label=Homepage title=GitHub class="footer-octicon d-none d-lg-block mr-lg-4" href=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/><svg height="24" class="octicon octicon-mark-github" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="24"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8 0C3.58.0.0 3.58.0 8c0 3.54 2.29 6.53 5.47 7.59.4.07.55-.17.55-.38.0-.19-.01-.82-.01-1.49-2.01.37-2.53-.49-2.69-.94-.09-.23-.48-.94-.82-1.13-.28-.15-.68-.52-.01-.53.63-.01 1.08.58 1.23.82.72 1.21 1.87.87 2.33.66.07-.52.28-.87.51-1.07-1.78-.2-3.64-.89-3.64-3.95.0-.87.31-1.59.82-2.15-.08-.2-.36-1.02.08-2.12.0.0.67-.21 2.2.82.64-.18 1.32-.27 2-.27s1.36.09 2 .27c1.53-1.04 2.2-.82 2.2-.82.44 1.1.16 1.92.08 2.12.51.56.82 1.27.82 2.15.0 3.07-1.87 3.75-3.65 3.95.29.25.54.73.54 1.48.0 1.07-.01 1.93-.01 2.2.0.21.15.46.55.38A8.013 8.013.0 0016 8c0-4.42-3.58-8-8-8z"/></svg></a><ul class="list-style-none d-flex flex-wrap col-12 flex-justify-center flex-lg-justify-between mb-2 mb-lg-0"><li class="mr-3 mr-lg-0">Theme by <a href=https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style>github-style</a></li><li class="mr-3 mr-lg-0">GitHub and the Invertocat logo are trademarks of <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub, Inc.</a></li></ul></div><div class="d-flex flex-justify-center pb-6"><span class="f6 text-gray-light"></span></div></div></body><script type=application/javascript src=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/js/github-style.js></script></html>

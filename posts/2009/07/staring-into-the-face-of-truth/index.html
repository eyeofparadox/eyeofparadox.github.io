truth</a></div></div></div><div class="Box-body px-5 pb-5" style=z-index:1><article class="markdown-body entry-content container-lg"><p>&ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since you&rsquo;ve done this, though,&rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&rsquo;ve become.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because it takes more effort than thinking, even if it <em>is</em> no more contrived than any other thing written; it isn&rsquo;t really a story,&rdquo; I respond. I do not have to add that this manner of confronting myself is one of the reasons my stories never get finished; she knows that as well as I do.</p><p>&ldquo;It helps when you need someone to talk to, though,&rdquo; she argues, crossing the room to sprawl on the couch next to my desk. There are times when I wish that I could have visual hallucinations; it would be nice to really see her when she goes to the trouble to try and fit herself into the world. Instead, I can only see her in the way I see what I am reading about in books, from everywhere and nowhere. Of course, with her, there is no book, no words; she is self-rendered thought. &ldquo;It gives me chance to be myself, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You mean, get some distance from being like this,&rdquo; I amend somewhat bitterly, in reference to all the unpleasant facts of my reality. Normally, I do not have the patience to write like this. Once I discovered I could split my attention two or three ways, it did not take long to become good enough at it that I would just talk to myself when I needed someone to talk to. I can confront any part of myself that way, even the parts that are smarter and wiser than I can normally be. I have come to believe that this is what angels and demons are, projections of ourselves, impressions of others and the personification of our hopes, beliefs, fears and doubts. It&rsquo;s what I think of as five-dimensional thinking. &ldquo;So, what do I need to talk about?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what you posted yesterday. Okay, that&rsquo;s still weird; it&rsquo;s as much my post as it was yours,&rdquo; she sighs and scoots closer to the opposite arm of the couch, tucking her feet under herself. &ldquo;I know what it has to sound like to anyone who reads it, and if people have trouble understanding and accepting a transgendered person, well&mldr;&rdquo; She cannot finish the thought, because I already know what she is going to say.</p><p>&ldquo;People have a hard time understanding and accepting anyone different from themselves. It took me too long to realize that there is nothing I can do to make anyone understand or accept me. People have to take it upon themselves to understand anything, and it is impossible to truly accept what is not understood. I am inclined to think that an inability to accept something is in fact proof that you do not truly understand it,&rdquo; I find myself declaring. I had been unable to understand what was expected of me as a child, and so the role imposed on me was unacceptable. When I learned enough to understand what made me a boy, I also understood that I never had a choice, and <em>that</em> was unacceptable. When I worked it out enough to realize I also had no power to change what I was, that <em>too</em> was unacceptable. This lead me to ask some devastating questions. What is the point of being able to choose if you are not given a choice &ndash; especially about something that virtually defines you? What is the point of living if you are given a life you did not want? &ldquo;I am not the only one to suspect that there has to be more to life than this, or that there is more to us, for that matter,&rdquo; I tell her, in response to her unstated concern for what was at the heart of that post.</p><p>She tilts her head and shrugs in agreement, picking at imaginary lint on her skirt. &ldquo;I know, but I did not stop at that, did I?&rdquo; I can feel her studying me. I can&rsquo;t really meet her eyes, but I can imagine myself looking over at her, seeing thoughts written on her face.</p><p>&ldquo;I know, some of this is impossible to put into words, but yeah, the post was really about believing in myself and the impulse to act on that belief,&rdquo; I admit, picking up on the thoughts this little game was bringing to the surface with a small sigh. &ldquo;Although, there really is nothing hard about changing the world. The world changes with or without our help. What is hard is getting the results you intended. I might have gone out on a ledge by saying what I wanted to do, or why I wanted to do it. If there was a problem with what I posted, it was not being able to say how it could be done.&rdquo;</p><p>She pulls her knees up to her chest and hugs them. I know what she&rsquo;s thinking, because I am thinking the same thing. I have not been able to invest the time and effort needed to figure that out. &ldquo;The hard part is not figuring out how it can be done. There&rsquo;s plenty of scope for the imagination there,&rdquo; she insists, prompting me to think of thousands of stories I&rsquo;ve read, and hundreds I&rsquo;ve tried to write, where suitable means were presented.</p><p>&ldquo;No, the trick is establishing that there are means and methods available, and pushing ourselves beyond our current understanding. It is kind of hard to work on that if it is not your job, though,&rdquo; I laugh, bitterly. Of course, there is no job like this. That has been the other reason I have been totally lost in this world. That sobers me up. &ldquo;Honestly, even the little I&rsquo;ve managed to find time to think about would take a lot of writing, and I don&rsquo;t need another &lsquo;job&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t get paid to do!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And yet you sit up all night writing a blog like this?&rdquo; she teases.</p><p>&ldquo;Until I figure out what to do, what will make a difference, I don&rsquo;t really have anything better to do,&rdquo; I point out tiredly. As usual, I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of all the things that are on my mind. Writing is too slow and time consuming a way to deal with such thoughts. She looks at me, knowingly, and I shrug. &ldquo;Things have to be done in their own way. If this were a story, I could skip over all the deep thinking. Even in a simple blog post, I could just focus on making a point. You intended to ask me how this is going to work. You really want to know how much more of this you have to endure.&rdquo; I close my eyes and lean back in my chair. I know what it would take to set her free, and that I have to find it in myself. The problem is, as long as I am not her, I can&rsquo;t really be me. I roll my head to the right and look at her. She cannot be seen, but she does not let that stop her. An obvious truth, always staring me in the face.</p></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div><script type=application/javascript src=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/js/toc.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/css/toc.css></div><div class="footer container-xl width-full p-responsive"><div class="position-relative d-flex flex-row-reverse flex-lg-row flex-wrap flex-lg-nowrap flex-justify-center flex-lg-justify-between flex-sm-items-center pt-6 pb-2 mt-6 f6 text-gray border-top border-gray-light"><a aria-label=Homepage title=GitHub class="footer-octicon d-none d-lg-block mr-lg-4" href=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/><svg height="24" class="octicon octicon-mark-github" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="24"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8 0C3.58.0.0 3.58.0 8c0 3.54 2.29 6.53 5.47 7.59.4.07.55-.17.55-.38.0-.19-.01-.82-.01-1.49-2.01.37-2.53-.49-2.69-.94-.09-.23-.48-.94-.82-1.13-.28-.15-.68-.52-.01-.53.63-.01 1.08.58 1.23.82.72 1.21 1.87.87 2.33.66.07-.52.28-.87.51-1.07-1.78-.2-3.64-.89-3.64-3.95.0-.87.31-1.59.82-2.15-.08-.2-.36-1.02.08-2.12.0.0.67-.21 2.2.82.64-.18 1.32-.27 2-.27s1.36.09 2 .27c1.53-1.04 2.2-.82 2.2-.82.44 1.1.16 1.92.08 2.12.51.56.82 1.27.82 2.15.0 3.07-1.87 3.75-3.65 3.95.29.25.54.73.54 1.48.0 1.07-.01 1.93-.01 2.2.0.21.15.46.55.38A8.013 8.013.0 0016 8c0-4.42-3.58-8-8-8z"/></svg></a><ul class="list-style-none d-flex flex-wrap col-12 flex-justify-center flex-lg-justify-between mb-2 mb-lg-0"><li class="mr-3 mr-lg-0">Theme by <a href=https://github.com/MeiK2333/github-style>github-style</a></li><li class="mr-3 mr-lg-0">GitHub and the Invertocat logo are trademarks of <a href=https://github.com/>GitHub, Inc.</a></li></ul></div><div class="d-flex flex-justify-center pb-6"><span class="f6 text-gray-light"></span></div></div></body><script type=application/javascript src=https://eyeofparadox.github.io/js/github-style.js></script></html>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/strong&gt;: My mind wandered back to division by zero and it suddenly struck me that, if applicable in nature, it would be the point where a value ceases to be &lt;em&gt;quanta&lt;/em&gt; and becomes &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;. I did not see it for a while. I got to it by thinking about what&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight in the concepts of quantum mechanics, and remembering a simple-but-paradoxical description of a hypersphere as &amp;ldquo;a sphere whose surface is nowhere, its focus is everywhere, and its radius infinite&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Divide by Zero</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/divide-by-zero/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/divide-by-zero/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

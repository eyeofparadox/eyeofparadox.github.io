&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you drag yourself through the hell you’re trapped in when you’re so broken it’s a miracle you can even move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you choke down the agony and anguish, and endure whatever punishment life heaps on top of it, for the unlikely and virtually impossible chance you will survive the pain long enough to discover what it’s like to be free of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Social Stratification</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-impact-of-social-stratification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-impact-of-social-stratification/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all human.

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with the ideas of caste and class, and tried to understand how anyone can willingly accept being &amp;ldquo;put in their place&amp;rdquo; by the people around them. In the end, I think it all comes down to the perception of power, the ways in which circumstances can be used to dominate society.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

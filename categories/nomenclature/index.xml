&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll let you follow the link for the original posting details. I&amp;rsquo;ve been focused on testing out a workflow for creating the world of Aeirn in 3D for Child of Paradox. Like much of this sort of thing, it&amp;rsquo;s also concept art for the series&amp;ndash;and there is a lot of it on my portfolio and gallery sites. I am still working on the writing side of things too. I use the time my computer is tied up rendering to jot down new notes, sort through old notes, and work out details like the naming of characters. That last is a bit harder than it sounds, because I attempted to write parts of the story at different times and each time I renamed people to fit the roles they had in each version I explored.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Goddess &amp;amp; A Girl [SPOILER]</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2019/06/a-goddess-a-girl-spoiler/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2019/06/a-goddess-a-girl-spoiler/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve set out a number of approaches to Child of Paradox over the years. Even recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve danced around my personal relationship with the evolution of the story, trying to deal with it in the characters&amp;rsquo; context. I have had to know the whole thing to handle the paradoxical influences, in contrast to the perspectives of both readers and characters. Warning of spoilers ahead, here&amp;rsquo;s a glimpse into the story behind the story: In addition to other notions I&amp;rsquo;ve shared, this is a slightly different take on the story. The premise begins with the dream within my nightmare. Within me, my ideal self retreated from reality propping up an alter ego that is in essence a demon. My dream was always a search for a way to be myself. My nightmare was being trapped in a world where I didn&amp;rsquo;t really exist. My demon was originally an angel, but in pursuit of my dream, it became possessive and took a key role in reshaping my dream into a reality where I could exist, though I did not live in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

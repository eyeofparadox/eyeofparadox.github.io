&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/strong&gt;: My mind wandered back to division by zero and it suddenly struck me that, if applicable in nature, it would be the point where a value ceases to be &lt;em&gt;quanta&lt;/em&gt; and becomes &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;. I did not see it for a while. I got to it by thinking about what&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight in the concepts of quantum mechanics, and remembering a simple-but-paradoxical description of a hypersphere as &amp;ldquo;a sphere whose surface is nowhere, its focus is everywhere, and its radius infinite&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Examples of the 4th Dimension</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2018/09/examples-of-the-4th-dimension/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2018/09/examples-of-the-4th-dimension/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a thought that just popped into my head after reviewing my last post. Right off the top of my head, I picked out two candidates for the fourth dimension of space; Scale and State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying principle used to distinguish them was a concept that is spatial in nature, that lies beyond the immediate scope of a volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking, a four dimensional space can theoretically contain an infinite number of volumes, much the way three dimensional space can potentially contain an infinite number of surfaces; what we typically experience as the expression of two dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taking Part in the Dance with our Eyes Closed</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/taking-part-in-the-dance-with-our-eyes-closed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/taking-part-in-the-dance-with-our-eyes-closed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is the embodiment of aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with the will to overcome the unanswerable statement of a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proceeds in the blind ambition of being read and comprehended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strives to commit to a more permanent memory the thoughts and ideas of the writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often as not, the written word is as quirky and unreliable as any memory, easily lost or misplaced, often transcended by thoughts that spring in the wake of ages, be they moments or millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Does it ever get better?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/04/does-it-ever-get-better/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/04/does-it-ever-get-better/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am well acquainted with the depths of despair; that place where words hurt in every way and never more than when they give the faintest glimmer of the only thing that could possibly be worse than despair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you drag yourself through the hell you’re trapped in when you’re so broken it’s a miracle you can even move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you choke down the agony and anguish, and endure whatever punishment life heaps on top of it, for the unlikely and virtually impossible chance you will survive the pain long enough to discover what it’s like to be free of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Point about Paradox</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2010/12/a-point-about-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2010/12/a-point-about-paradox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the eternal moment, the past and the future are simply a matter of perspective and the past can be influenced by overlapping reinforcement or the intent of the resolving future. A time paradox is a self-informing sequence within a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic grandfather paradox assumes that time is linear, ignoring the fact that the appearance of a person from the future is an unprecedented event at that point in the past. It also ignores the consequences of his absence from the point of his departure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Spark</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/a-spark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/a-spark/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My eyes opened and this is what I saw. You can in yourself be anything you desire. You create yourself from a point. You define your own existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soul defines itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What words cannot define, they can characterize, so that the truth may be recognized as it is encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The existence of a soul is absolute, at once all and nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The qualities of a soul are both infinite and eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is not a question, nor is a soul an answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is an expression, a unique, individual creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I gazed in wonder, I realized that even before a soul embraces the awareness of other souls, the darkness of a soul embraces the light of other souls, filling the emptiness of its existence with the certainty of others, both as a foundation for its own reality, and a medium for the realization of its self.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Staring into the Face of Truth</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/staring-into-the-face-of-truth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/staring-into-the-face-of-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Impulse</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/impulse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/impulse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I? Why am I here? What is the point of my existence? These are questions we all ask at some point in our lives, and we can go our entire lives without knowing the answer. I suspect that a lot of people try to avoid thinking about it, not knowing how to begin answering, and I wonder how long a person can go without asking them. There are an endless number of situations and circumstances that can force us to confront these questions, and other soul searching questions like them. For me, the question can come up as a result of gender issues, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had it come up in many other circumstances. The answers, whatever they are, test the limits of my understanding, because in many ways I am the awareness brought into focus by both the sum and the gestalt of my understanding. In the scope of my understanding, I am aware that I am not driven by a desire to be female. I am driven by an impulse that is at once too simple and too complex for words, because words will never serve to express that impulse. Because I found myself in a body that I was not able to express myself properly in, it was only natural for me to become obsessed with finding a better way to express myself. I put a lot of thought and effort into figuring out the best way to embody myself in human terms, and because I was thinking in human terms, my self image is based on understanding the compromises that allowed me to be as true to myself as possible. Of course, human limitations are based on the limitations of reality, which are the perceived limits of existence &amp;ndash; or rather the limits of perception. The plain, simple and painful truth is that I am driven to do something that can not be done within those limits &amp;ndash; as we understand them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/it-takes-a-village-to-break-a-child/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/it-takes-a-village-to-break-a-child/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Point Penetrating Points Overlapping</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/point-penetrating-points-overlapping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/point-penetrating-points-overlapping/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A number of my posts, particularly the ones dealing with transgender issues in my life, have been written on a long, dark night of the soul. It can be difficult to come back and read what I&amp;rsquo;ve posted and resist the urge to delete what I&amp;rsquo;ve written, because of how dark they are. I have moments when I think, if ever a family member happened to read them, some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve written could really hurt them. That was never the intention, and yet, there is a ring of truth to the posts I am not able to deny. It is an unfortunate fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurt a great deal by people who never meant me harm because of things neither I nor they had any control over. It is not their fault that efforts to encourage my growth and development as a son or brother caused me so much pain; they were simply responding to what they perceived me to be. Our current society is the end product of thousands of generations of people struggling through life trying to make sense out of it. If that resulted in the division of human traits into masculine and feminine, and if the cultivation of gender roles led to a society that could not understand that there was a difference between the things that make people who they are and the things that make them what they are, it is not possible to assign fault or blame to any specific group, let alone a given person. As much as it would have made a difference in my life to have been raised among people who were more perceptive, or in a society that was more accepting of individual differences, I would still have grown up with the more difficult problem of being a girl in a boy&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Matter and Movement in Four--or More--Dimensions</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/matter-and-movement-in-four-or-more-dimensions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/matter-and-movement-in-four-or-more-dimensions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;These days, it only takes a little curiosity, access to the Internet, and a bit of patience to find explanations of progressive spatial dimensions or examples of four dimensional geometry, such as the old favorite the hyper-square.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of them probably just glance at an article to see if it&amp;rsquo;s relevant to the search that brought them here. One or two might actually read something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in a blue moon, someone leaves a short comment.&lt;/p&gt;

My existence may be supported by reality, the physical, chemical, biological and sociological fabric out of which we all seem to be spun, but none of these things are me. I exist in my mind and that is why the way I perceive myself in my own mind can not only contradict my physical form, but trump it in importance to my survival. I have heard the theories and arguments on nature versus nurture and taking my own experience into consideration I can say that there are elements in both that can help shape who you are, but only by presenting the options or stimulus necessary for you to determine who you are. I cannot tell you if this is a process of creation or revelation; it feels like both. I am the driving and defining force within my own mind; my mind is the structure and articulation of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It is Where You Can, and Yet... CAN You?

In a sense, that is appropriate enough; isn&amp;rsquo;t it a common recommendation that writers draw from their own experiences? I often feel that my escape into fantasy or science fiction has been good for my sanity, but bad for my hopes of a writing career. I could be wrong. I see enough gender bending in books, manga and film. I find it interesting that most cases involve a boy turned into a girl against his will. Interestingly enough, the first time I picked up an issue of Ranma 1/2, I put it back when I discovered that Ranma considered his ability to become a girl a curse. I did not think I could stomach reading about a guy hated having what I so desperately longed for. Months later, I gave Ranma 1/2 a second chance and eventually came to like him and appreciate what he was going through. I became a fan, read all the manga, watched as much of the anime as I could stand (if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried, you know why I say that), and even wrote over a million words of fan fiction. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to complete volume five; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to give it my attention when I am struggling to hold myself together and it&amp;rsquo;s writing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recapitulation &amp;amp; Reflection</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/recapitulation-reflection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/recapitulation-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A person looking at my blog might get the impression that I do not get much writing done, and it is true that there are a lot of things in my life that get in the way of me writing most of the things I want to. The inside dope is that much of what I do write, I am not sure I want to share. Does anyone not afflicted with gender dysphoria even care about transgender issues? I honestly do not know. I&amp;rsquo;ve known people who were sympathetic, curious, interested, confused, upset and even terrified by the topic. It is an uncomfortable topic, and I do not blame people for not wanting to talk about it; and if no one wants to talk about it (except those of us who have to live with it) why would anyone want to read about it? I dunno, but I do have a lot to say about it, and sometimes I do not realize how much until the words start to spill out. Once they do, I begin to find clarity and focus. It helps me to write it, it helps me to come back and read it, and it has a place here in my blog, because it deals with the paradox of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Absolute Truth</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/10/the-absolute-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/10/the-absolute-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The best representation of a thing is the thing itself and yet there are things that we experience great difficulty recognizing in their true form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In speaking of the truth, what we have is a word&amp;ndash;and as a representation of a thing, a word provides a label for a concept that is meaningless without an accurate understanding of what the concept represents.&lt;/p&gt;

Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gravity in a Distributed, Process Driven, Information-Based Universe</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/gravity-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/gravity-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes. Today, we have the advantage of having had great minds ponder the mystery and define what can be observed and inferred by studying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton pondered the question &amp;ldquo;why do objects fall?&amp;rdquo; and provided us with a theory of universal gravity (along with his three laws of motion). He essentially defined the terms we now use to describe and quantify gravity, the force that attracts objects with mass to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Damage is Done</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/the-damage-is-done/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/the-damage-is-done/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what is going to happen next. I wonder if I can hold it together to get a job and move out on my own. I wonder if I can manage to hold on to that job and support myself. I wonder, because I am not really wanted where I am. The only support I can count on, the support of my family and friends, is conditional. It always has been. It has always been conditional on me finding a way to get steady on my own two feet. The irony of that always brings a smile of agony. I know what they want, and that they want it for me, for me to become independent. It is something I do want. The problem is that it leaves me alone inside a life that holds absolutely no meaning for me. This person that I pretend to be, because he means something to his friends and family, means nothing to me. He does not mean enough, to the people who employ him, to have any purpose. He can be replaced by anyone and cannot compete with the living.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What is the Point?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/03/what-is-the-point/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/03/what-is-the-point/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am back in school, freshly enrolled in the University of Phoenix in pursuit of a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Information Technology&amp;ndash;Visual Communications.

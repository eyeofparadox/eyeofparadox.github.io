&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thought for the day&lt;/strong&gt;: My mind wandered back to division by zero and it suddenly struck me that, if applicable in nature, it would be the point where a value ceases to be &lt;em&gt;quanta&lt;/em&gt; and becomes &lt;em&gt;qualia&lt;/em&gt;. I did not see it for a while. I got to it by thinking about what&amp;rsquo;s hidden in plain sight in the concepts of quantum mechanics, and remembering a simple-but-paradoxical description of a hypersphere as &amp;ldquo;a sphere whose surface is nowhere, its focus is everywhere, and its radius infinite&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Musings On Physics &amp;amp; Metaphysics</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2018/09/musings-on-physics-metaphysics/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2018/09/musings-on-physics-metaphysics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of time has passed since I had the impulse to post anything; that does not mean I stopped writing my thoughts down!

I know that many of these posts have the potential to hurt me, professionally, and yet they serve the essential and undeniable need for self-expression that is ultimately the only way I can justify my existence. I would not be surprised to find that these posts drive more people away than they ever manage to enlighten, and shade my other writing with a transferred contempt. I am sure many people who do read through them must think, &amp;ldquo;this has to be exaggerated,&amp;rdquo; though I must confess that my best effort to put these feelings into words fall short&amp;ndash;hence, I keep revisiting them, trying to vent the agony in &amp;ldquo;a whisper of hollow words to dress up the shattering, inarticulate screams of a forever breaking heart.&amp;rdquo; If you choose to read this, to know what I cannot allow myself to show on the surface, just know that I overcome this pain in every moment I manage to present that calm, composed facade. I am not looking for pity, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I feel sorry for myself; I am not sorry to be me&amp;ndash;there is just no easy way to present myself to you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Poetry and Figurative Language Paper</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/poetry-and-figurative-language-paper/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/poetry-and-figurative-language-paper/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pen and a piece of paper might technically be the only “tools” a poet requires, but there are many “literary” tools at his (or her) disposal as well. In addition to imagination and a little flirtation with the Muse, a poet uses many other elements of writing to craft his (or her) messages to the heart and soul. This paper looks at the works of three great poets, three extraordinary poems, and explores the imagery, metaphors, rhyme and structure that make them so great. Examples from William Shakespeare’s sonnet, “When, in Disgrace with Fortune and Men’s Eyes” (Thiel, 2004, p.311), Robert Frost’s “The Road Not Taken” (Thiel, 2004, p.297), and Craig Raine’s, “A Martian Sends a Postcard Home” (Thiel, 2004, p.308) will be used to discuss the importance of figurative language in poetry and how it communicates to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Taking Part in the Dance with our Eyes Closed</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/taking-part-in-the-dance-with-our-eyes-closed/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/08/taking-part-in-the-dance-with-our-eyes-closed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is the embodiment of aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It begins with the will to overcome the unanswerable statement of a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It proceeds in the blind ambition of being read and comprehended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strives to commit to a more permanent memory the thoughts and ideas of the writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often as not, the written word is as quirky and unreliable as any memory, easily lost or misplaced, often transcended by thoughts that spring in the wake of ages, be they moments or millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Does it ever get better?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/04/does-it-ever-get-better/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2016/04/does-it-ever-get-better/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am well acquainted with the depths of despair; that place where words hurt in every way and never more than when they give the faintest glimmer of the only thing that could possibly be worse than despair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you drag yourself through the hell you’re trapped in when you’re so broken it’s a miracle you can even move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope makes you choke down the agony and anguish, and endure whatever punishment life heaps on top of it, for the unlikely and virtually impossible chance you will survive the pain long enough to discover what it’s like to be free of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Do current theories on Black Holes address Forces other than Gravity?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2014/01/do-current-theories-on-black-holes-address-forces-other-than-gravity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2014/01/do-current-theories-on-black-holes-address-forces-other-than-gravity/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I stumble across a question I have to stop and ask, but I am usually in the middle of something that needs to be done. So, I put it off for later, often forgetting to even write the question down. I know this one is going to come back to plague me, so I am putting it out there in the hopes I can come back and do some research on it later, while giving the random visitor to my site a chance to comment on it or point me toward a source with something to say about the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It's been a while...</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2014/01/its-been-a-while/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2014/01/its-been-a-while/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past few years chasing after The Job and sliding down to the point where I&amp;rsquo;m scrambling to just grab A job. It&amp;rsquo;s an old, familiar story, and the details aren&amp;rsquo;t really that important. For the sake of my blog, all that matters is that I have not had much time to put my thoughts down, and no time to review or post any that might have been worth sharing. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure when that will change, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a crack at it. There&amp;rsquo;s always the chance that my blog could open the door to some kind of paying work.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Point about Paradox</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2010/12/a-point-about-paradox/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2010/12/a-point-about-paradox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In the eternal moment, the past and the future are simply a matter of perspective and the past can be influenced by overlapping reinforcement or the intent of the resolving future. A time paradox is a self-informing sequence within a point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic grandfather paradox assumes that time is linear, ignoring the fact that the appearance of a person from the future is an unprecedented event at that point in the past. It also ignores the consequences of his absence from the point of his departure in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is This It?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/is-this-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/is-this-it/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my way home on Wednesday, September 23, 2009, with my dinner in hand, and I swear I just wanted to sit down and eat but I knew the bus would show up the minute I did. I had intended to eat in the restaurant, but for some reason the counter person handed me my meal in a bag to go. Since my usual table was occupied, I sighed and left; the entire day had been off like that. I should have known the universe had it in for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Spark</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/a-spark/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/09/a-spark/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My eyes opened and this is what I saw. You can in yourself be anything you desire. You create yourself from a point. You define your own existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A soul defines itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What words cannot define, they can characterize, so that the truth may be recognized as it is encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The existence of a soul is absolute, at once all and nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The qualities of a soul are both infinite and eternal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is not a question, nor is a soul an answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is a statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A soul is an expression, a unique, individual creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I gazed in wonder, I realized that even before a soul embraces the awareness of other souls, the darkness of a soul embraces the light of other souls, filling the emptiness of its existence with the certainty of others, both as a foundation for its own reality, and a medium for the realization of its self.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Staring into the Face of Truth</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/staring-into-the-face-of-truth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/staring-into-the-face-of-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story is as good a way to organize your thoughts as anything else,&amp;rdquo; she points out, poised in the shadows in the doorway. I quickly conclude that she is playing the part of my conscience. That, or devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Either way, she&amp;rsquo;s me. I cannot say she does not really exist without implying the same of myself. She is in my mind, and of my mind, so I do not look at her. She cannot be seen, not in the flesh anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s not like I have to look at her to see her. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, though,&amp;rdquo; she observes, watching me carefully. I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s something on her mind. I can feel it. Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s on my mind, but I have long since learned that her thoughts are her own when she chooses to assert herself. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like being in two places at the same time, a way to step outside my normal perspective and look at what I&amp;rsquo;ve become.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Impulse</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/impulse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/impulse/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Who am I? Why am I here? What is the point of my existence? These are questions we all ask at some point in our lives, and we can go our entire lives without knowing the answer. I suspect that a lot of people try to avoid thinking about it, not knowing how to begin answering, and I wonder how long a person can go without asking them. There are an endless number of situations and circumstances that can force us to confront these questions, and other soul searching questions like them. For me, the question can come up as a result of gender issues, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had it come up in many other circumstances. The answers, whatever they are, test the limits of my understanding, because in many ways I am the awareness brought into focus by both the sum and the gestalt of my understanding. In the scope of my understanding, I am aware that I am not driven by a desire to be female. I am driven by an impulse that is at once too simple and too complex for words, because words will never serve to express that impulse. Because I found myself in a body that I was not able to express myself properly in, it was only natural for me to become obsessed with finding a better way to express myself. I put a lot of thought and effort into figuring out the best way to embody myself in human terms, and because I was thinking in human terms, my self image is based on understanding the compromises that allowed me to be as true to myself as possible. Of course, human limitations are based on the limitations of reality, which are the perceived limits of existence &amp;ndash; or rather the limits of perception. The plain, simple and painful truth is that I am driven to do something that can not be done within those limits &amp;ndash; as we understand them.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It Takes a Village to Break a Child</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/it-takes-a-village-to-break-a-child/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/it-takes-a-village-to-break-a-child/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I do not often get comments on my blog; if I exclude the pingbacks, spam and my own replies, I&amp;rsquo;ve received twenty-two comments from ten different individuals since I started the eye of paradox two years ago. Four of those people have identified themselves as transgendered, and like every transgendered person I&amp;rsquo;ve known, it has affected their lives as bad or worse than mine and I do not have to explain myself to them to be understood. For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve understood that this condition is difficult or even impossible for people who have not experienced it to comprehend. In order to live with normal people, the &amp;ldquo;cisgendered&amp;rdquo; if I use the term that&amp;rsquo;s come into use to describe those who identify with their birth sex, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to go to incredible lengths to comprehend and empathize with them. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many, many times to find a way to describe what it feels like to live with this condition, hoping to make it easier for my family and friends to understand me. As I mentioned, I do not always like what comes out when I write on this topic, because it is a very intensely emotional issue and intensely emotional writing just encourages people to accuse me of being mellow-dramatic. I honestly expect most people to be driven away by the things I have written. Growing up, it did not take me long to learn how incredibly unsympathetic most people are about this issue. I was never asked to explain myself. With the exception of my adopted mother, who confronted me when I was six to ask if I wanted to be a girl, no one ever asked me why I acted like a girl. By the time she asked, I knew better than to admit it, since every other time someone noticed I was just slapped, spanked, or jerked around while being criticized for acting like a girl and being commanded to stop. That does not mean I was not asking myself why I acted like a girl. Even though the question was often on my mind, the only answer that ever rang true was the one that the facts denied.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Point Penetrating Points Overlapping</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/point-penetrating-points-overlapping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/point-penetrating-points-overlapping/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A number of my posts, particularly the ones dealing with transgender issues in my life, have been written on a long, dark night of the soul. It can be difficult to come back and read what I&amp;rsquo;ve posted and resist the urge to delete what I&amp;rsquo;ve written, because of how dark they are. I have moments when I think, if ever a family member happened to read them, some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve written could really hurt them. That was never the intention, and yet, there is a ring of truth to the posts I am not able to deny. It is an unfortunate fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve been hurt a great deal by people who never meant me harm because of things neither I nor they had any control over. It is not their fault that efforts to encourage my growth and development as a son or brother caused me so much pain; they were simply responding to what they perceived me to be. Our current society is the end product of thousands of generations of people struggling through life trying to make sense out of it. If that resulted in the division of human traits into masculine and feminine, and if the cultivation of gender roles led to a society that could not understand that there was a difference between the things that make people who they are and the things that make them what they are, it is not possible to assign fault or blame to any specific group, let alone a given person. As much as it would have made a difference in my life to have been raised among people who were more perceptive, or in a society that was more accepting of individual differences, I would still have grown up with the more difficult problem of being a girl in a boy&amp;rsquo;s body.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Matter and Movement in Four--or More--Dimensions</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/matter-and-movement-in-four-or-more-dimensions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/07/matter-and-movement-in-four-or-more-dimensions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;These days, it only takes a little curiosity, access to the Internet, and a bit of patience to find explanations of progressive spatial dimensions or examples of four dimensional geometry, such as the old favorite the hyper-square.&lt;/p&gt;

My existence may be supported by reality, the physical, chemical, biological and sociological fabric out of which we all seem to be spun, but none of these things are me. I exist in my mind and that is why the way I perceive myself in my own mind can not only contradict my physical form, but trump it in importance to my survival. I have heard the theories and arguments on nature versus nurture and taking my own experience into consideration I can say that there are elements in both that can help shape who you are, but only by presenting the options or stimulus necessary for you to determine who you are. I cannot tell you if this is a process of creation or revelation; it feels like both. I am the driving and defining force within my own mind; my mind is the structure and articulation of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Slightly Left of Nowhere</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/slightly-left-of-nowhere/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/slightly-left-of-nowhere/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I rarely have time to write or draw, and as my friend keeps reminding me, I&amp;rsquo;ve little hope making a living as an artist or writer. I have to agree, knowing that even brilliant writing and art takes a massive investment of time and effort up front. That seems to be a recurring theme in my life, however. I have never really had the things I needed to succeed in life. I have almost always had a reasonable substitute for the things I lack, which I am sure could have been used to achieve success, if success meant anything in the absence of a life worth living. The hard, cold facts of life undermine my identity and force me to live the life of a person that does not exist. I succeeded in earning enough to live and function as a man, but the process left me with no sense of myself as a person; nothing that I did felt real to me and nothing that I engaged in felt meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>It is Where You Can, and Yet...

In a sense, that is appropriate enough; isn&amp;rsquo;t it a common recommendation that writers draw from their own experiences? I often feel that my escape into fantasy or science fiction has been good for my sanity, but bad for my hopes of a writing career. I could be wrong. I see enough gender bending in books, manga and film. I find it interesting that most cases involve a boy turned into a girl against his will. Interestingly enough, the first time I picked up an issue of Ranma 1/2, I put it back when I discovered that Ranma considered his ability to become a girl a curse. I did not think I could stomach reading about a guy hated having what I so desperately longed for. Months later, I gave Ranma 1/2 a second chance and eventually came to like him and appreciate what he was going through. I became a fan, read all the manga, watched as much of the anime as I could stand (if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried, you know why I say that), and even wrote over a million words of fan fiction. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to complete volume five; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to give it my attention when I am struggling to hold myself together and it&amp;rsquo;s writing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t pay.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Recapitulation &amp;amp; Reflection</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/recapitulation-reflection/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2009/06/recapitulation-reflection/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A person looking at my blog might get the impression that I do not get much writing done, and it is true that there are a lot of things in my life that get in the way of me writing most of the things I want to. The inside dope is that much of what I do write, I am not sure I want to share. Does anyone not afflicted with gender dysphoria even care about transgender issues? I honestly do not know. I&amp;rsquo;ve known people who were sympathetic, curious, interested, confused, upset and even terrified by the topic. It is an uncomfortable topic, and I do not blame people for not wanting to talk about it; and if no one wants to talk about it (except those of us who have to live with it) why would anyone want to read about it? I dunno, but I do have a lot to say about it, and sometimes I do not realize how much until the words start to spill out. Once they do, I begin to find clarity and focus. It helps me to write it, it helps me to come back and read it, and it has a place here in my blog, because it deals with the paradox of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Absolute Truth</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/10/the-absolute-truth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/10/the-absolute-truth/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The best representation of a thing is the thing itself and yet there are things that we experience great difficulty recognizing in their true form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In speaking of the truth, what we have is a word&amp;ndash;and as a representation of a thing, a word provides a label for a concept that is meaningless without an accurate understanding of what the concept represents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the true meaning of truth is a challenge because it calls upon itself for validation, which is a logical fallacy. Or is it?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fly By - Asteroids</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/fly-by-asteroids/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/fly-by-asteroids/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="images/a-aism-space-art-fly-by-0505081.jpg" alt="Fly By"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I am posting images from my space art portfolio. This is a reworking of one of the first space art cover illustrations I attempted, but never submitted, for Analog. It was created in Photoshop as part of a new series of space art conceived as &amp;ldquo;variations on a theme&amp;rdquo; using similar elements in different ways. In keeping with the role of a concept artist, this series is supposed to demonstrate an ability to create a number of detailed proof images quickly, so each image in this series was produced in an evening or afternoon. The fact that the images all share a common origin and elements also gives them a kind of storyboard quality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Divide by Zero</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/divide-by-zero/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/divide-by-zero/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to divide a number by zero? Conventional thinking in mathematics declares this to be impossible, but this answer is contingent on a point of view. The problem here lies in the normal interpretation of the value of the number zero; a representation of &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo; zero is seen as more of a place holder, a number that has no value. By contrast, infinity is a value that has no number. In multiplication, the value of any number times zero is zero. It is like declaring a number in theory. It is like saying &amp;ldquo;no number&amp;rdquo; and when it comes to division by zero, one might as well be saying &amp;ldquo;no division&amp;rdquo; because use of the number zero declares no number of parts into which a value could be separated, including one, producing a value in no parts. The common assumption is that division by zero would equal infinity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blue Horizon</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/blue-horizon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/blue-horizon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://eyeofparadox.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/20070414-blue-horizon-640x900-20090414-1324-00.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="images/20070414-blue-horizon-640x900-20090414-1324-00.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once more, I thought it would be nice to add a little visual content to the eye of paradox by posting one of the images from my voidscape collection of space art. This is actually a pre-visualization done at a smaller scale than I normally work in Photoshop, using small Terragen renders, to help with a work in progress. To those familiar with my Art is Murder gallery as Alexandrea V. Morgan, the planets first appeared on a wallpaper graphic titled &amp;ldquo;Artemis and Athena&amp;rdquo; which was a sneak-preview of the the project I was working on. However, this piece uses the planets in the same orientation they were originally developed, rather than the vertical composition I posted on Art is Murder, to try to keep the lighting of the planets somewhat consistent with the lighting of the terrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Gravity in a Distributed, Process Driven, Information-Based Universe</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/gravity-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/09/gravity-in-a-distributed-process-driven-information-based-universe/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To a curious mind, gravity is a curious phenomenon. The more one pays attention to it, the more fascinating and mysterious it becomes. Today, we have the advantage of having had great minds ponder the mystery and define what can be observed and inferred by studying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newton pondered the question &amp;ldquo;why do objects fall?&amp;rdquo; and provided us with a theory of universal gravity (along with his three laws of motion). He essentially defined the terms we now use to describe and quantify gravity, the force that attracts objects with mass to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Above the Horizon</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/07/above-the-horizon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/07/above-the-horizon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://eyeofparadox.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/a-aism-xscape.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="images/a-aism-xscape.jpg" alt="Above the Horizon" title="a-aism-xscape"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt to feature some of my artwork here on the eye of paradox. I have always had a strong interest in becoming a professional artist, in spite of having little time and insufficient resources to develop my skills to that level. I started out with the right intentions, pursuing an art degree, but the path I started on led down a different and darker route. I never gave up on the idea, even though it&amp;rsquo;s taken a long time to get to where I am now as an artist and a writer. In the hopes of breaking into publication creating science fiction themed cover art, I became interested in creating voidscapes, images set in outer space. I have learned enough by now to know how much more I have to learn to achieve that goal. I have continued to improve with each work, and I will post some of my more recent efforts or even works in progress as the whim strikes me. Of course, if I get some kind of response to my efforts, the whim might strike more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Damage is Done</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/the-damage-is-done/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/the-damage-is-done/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder what is going to happen next. I wonder if I can hold it together to get a job and move out on my own. I wonder if I can manage to hold on to that job and support myself. I wonder, because I am not really wanted where I am. The only support I can count on, the support of my family and friends, is conditional. It always has been. It has always been conditional on me finding a way to get steady on my own two feet. The irony of that always brings a smile of agony. I know what they want, and that they want it for me, for me to become independent. It is something I do want. The problem is that it leaves me alone inside a life that holds absolutely no meaning for me. This person that I pretend to be, because he means something to his friends and family, means nothing to me. He does not mean enough, to the people who employ him, to have any purpose. He can be replaced by anyone and cannot compete with the living.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A True Identity is Nothing to Fear</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/a-true-identity-is-nothing-to-fear/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/a-true-identity-is-nothing-to-fear/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The response I received to my last post, &lt;a href="http://eyeofparadox.com/2008/05/11/conundrum/"&gt;Conundrum&lt;/a&gt;, prompted me to check out the recent posts of the people who commented or posted blogs in the transgender category yesterday. As a result, I became aware of the outcry against the appointment of Dr. Kenneth Zucker, Dr. Ray Blanchard, and J. Michael Bailey, by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), to the work group responsible for revising the entry for Gender Identity Disorder (GID) in the Manual for Diagnosis of Mental Disorders. The &lt;a href="http://genderoutlaw.wordpress.com/2008/05/11/the-apa-appointment-of-zucker-et-al-and-gender-variant-children/"&gt;first blog&lt;/a&gt; I read on the subject, posted by Gender Outlaw, struck a very personal chord with me. In addition to being transgendered, I was put up for adoption when I was four and spent a year in foster care while the state attempted to contact my biological father so that he might claim his custody rights. It was during my time in foster care that I was terrorized out of identifying myself as a girl and learned to keep my true identity a secret. It took time to learn how to restrain my natural impulses and act like a boy, and the threat of abandonment and rejection was used to reinforce &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; behavior. By the time I was adopted, this conditioning had scarred me for life, rendering me incapable of trusting anyone with my true thoughts and feelings. When my new family noticed my feminine traits and confronted me with questions about my behavior, or offered even a mild rebuke for &amp;ldquo;acting like a girl&amp;rdquo; I was consumed with that fear of rejection and lied to deflect any suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Conundrum</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/conundrum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/05/conundrum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today I find myself puzzling over the weird fact of my existence. The Internet created an opportunity to show a side of myself that I had long kept hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, at least in the terms used by the medical community (and by extension, the LGBTQ community), transgendered; in spite of being born and raised male the core of my identity is female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a convenient or desirable situation, and it puts me in constant conflict between who I am and what I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What is the Point?</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/03/what-is-the-point/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/03/what-is-the-point/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am back in school, freshly enrolled in the University of Phoenix in pursuit of a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Degree in Information Technology&amp;ndash;Visual Communications. I do not have a great deal of time outside of work to devote to this, so I was naturally put out when the site went down in the middle of a post. Not just any post, but a post in which I found myself inspired to posit a somewhat challenging question. Of course that post is now forever lost, inspiring this wonderful missive. When you strive to do not only what is required of you, when you strive to do more than is expected of you and stumble into a thought or question that has real potential, only to have that effort vanish without a trace, does it not make you wonder if there is any point?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Point Paradox</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/point-paradox/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/point-paradox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;“Detailing the dynamics of point paradox has never been easy, but the founding principle is prime awareness, the awareness of one, all and none&amp;quot; she elaborated, settling lightly on the arm of the couch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Point paradox is initially a question of absolutes. An absolute can be represented with a value of ‘one’, ‘zero’ and ‘infinite’. These values are all essentially equal, depending on perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The evolution of the soul begins with the exploration of this prime awareness, which is initially the struggle of one to comprehend the duality of all and none.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Medium of Existence</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/the-medium-of-existence/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/the-medium-of-existence/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;“A soul is absolute and absolutes are autonomous,” she asserted firmly. “A mind is paradoxical, acting as an inclusive, exclusive and occlusive interface between absolutes, abstractions and manifestations. A mind, with the absolute of a soul as its foundation, is the focus of existence, whether real, surreal or ideal. In short, the mind is the medium of existence, and a single mind can coordinate the disposition of the absolute, the absolutes, and any distillation derived there from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I'm not dead yet...</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/im-not-dead-yet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2008/02/im-not-dead-yet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The rare and occasional visitor to the eye of paradox will note that I have been absent for the most part from my own blog. Ironically, this is not because I have nothing to say. Quite the opposite; I have too much to say and too little time to spend on writing any of it down. That is my reward for trying to improve my education and hold down a steady job. It underscores the problem of trying to do what is expected of you. I am expected to find my place in the world in spite of the fact that there is no place for me in this world. If you broke me up into bits and pieces, there is some place in the world for each of those parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Mind Races On While the Pen Drags Behind</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-mind-races-on-while-the-pen-drags-behind/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-mind-races-on-while-the-pen-drags-behind/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My previous post on &lt;em&gt;The Paradox of Death&lt;/em&gt; is a bit more stream of consciousness than I had intended. That is one of the things that happens when writing about thinking existentially. I know I am going to have to reassess what I wrote; there are a lot of good thoughts in there, but I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised if people find it difficult to read.

It is its own prerequisite and it hurts think about why or how. The only thing that hurts more is trying to make sense &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; existing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, given our circumstances, we can&amp;rsquo;t really afford to take it for granted. By a certain age, we know that death awaits, but what does it really mean, in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its not a box you can just think you way out of, but its always safe to assume there is no valid alternative to &lt;em&gt;being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Social Stratification</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-impact-of-social-stratification/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-impact-of-social-stratification/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re all human.

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it boggles the mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve grown up with the ideas of caste and class, and tried to understand how anyone can willingly accept being &amp;ldquo;put in their place&amp;rdquo; by the people around them. In the end, I think it all comes down to the perception of power, the ways in which circumstances can be used to dominate society.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Still Scratching That Itch</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/still-scratching-that-itch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/still-scratching-that-itch/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The whole moving and searching for a better job thing is going slowly, so even with school work, there&amp;rsquo;s been time to write.

&lt;p&gt;Being on public assistance or living on a reservation, the cost of that free income or housing is having to live in poverty. It provides just enough to survive but not enough to advance. While many assistance programs include job training and placement programs, the jobs one can qualify for rarely provide better incomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Take a Moment to Reflect</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/take-a-moment-to-reflect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/take-a-moment-to-reflect/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Even with the best intentions no one has the right to impose a system of thought or action on anyone against their will.

&lt;p&gt;Anything can serve as criteria for grouping, but because this is a perceptual-interpretive process; differences and similarities in physical characteristics are the most prevalent. As we learn and grow, we also associate ideas and experiences with the items in our cognitive inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We give values to people, places and things based on personal experience, inherited attitudes and beliefs, and assumptions.

Strangely, I can dance through other places where most people crawl along blindly in fear and confusion or turn and run from in terror. I am not like everyone else, and I can not just be like everyone else and do what everyone else does. In order to live like other people, I have to learn the role and act the part &amp;ndash; but the performance I put on never ends and by going through the motions I end up not having a life of my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Price of Admission</title><link>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-price-of-admission/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eyeofparadox.github.io/posts/2007/08/the-price-of-admission/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;What is a society, what is it made up of and how does it work?

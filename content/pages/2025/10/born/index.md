I am the dreamer and I am the dream  
Alone and my own and yet never seen  
I am within and I am without  
I am the one who coupled with doubt  
I am the slayer and I am the slain  
Taking my pleasure embracing the pain  
A passionate phoenix torn  
  
I am the artist and I am the art  
With patience and anguish I figured it out  
I am the voice and I am the tone  
I am the vision my dreaming has shown  
I am the will and I am the way  
And I am the coin with which I must pay  
A choice I'll never mourn  
  
I am the actor and I am the act  
body and vessel that bloods the pact  
I am the master and I am the slave  
I am the soul I've struggled to save  
I am the promise that is calling  
Entering freely, awakened and willing  
To lose the mask I've worn  
  
I am my pattern and I am my part  
I am the focus, the stop and the start  
As I am the brilliance, the burning star  
I am also the darkness that stretches afar  
By all that is sacred, profound and profane  
The moment has come to claim my domain  
I am my own daughter born

**What happens when the main character of your great, unwritten epic tracks you down to find out why you haven't written her story? Read _The Price of Dreams_ to find out.** With a projected length of 30,000 words, _The Price of Dreams_ is intended to be a 9 chapter novella drawn closely from my life, and offering a glimpse of the final form of the story I've labored to write for a few decades.

This is going up here primarily to see if it gets any positive reception. I posted a scene titled [The Price of Dreams](http://avmorgan.deviantart.com/art/The-Price-of-Dreams-128084470?q=gallery%3Aavmorgan%2F23548192&qo=1) back in July of 2009, and I finally decided to take a crack at the prologue story it belongs to in 2014. This is still basically the rough draft, and if you're reading this, you're part of my test audience. If this gets more than a few hundred views, or more than a hundred comments, I'll see if I can get it published.

I'm curious to see what people think, so comments are welcome. Oh, and yeah, this is about as "naked in public" as I can get. This is a true story, and a complete work of fiction--just one of the many paradoxes you'll face in this story. It's not done to mess with you. It's just a consequence of how messed up my life is. Don't let it mess with your head.

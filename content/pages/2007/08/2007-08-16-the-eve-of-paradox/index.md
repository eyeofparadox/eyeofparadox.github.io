This project combines fantasy and science fiction to explore the nature of its protagonists and that of their native worlds. In worlds where the boundaries between magic and technology merge, and mere human beings have harnessed that power, it is the human question that comes to the fore, and the human psyche that waits to be explored.

Over the years, I have tried to develop ideas into book form. Typically, these manuscripts are pushed aside incomplete as other demands are made on my time and when I am able to return to them, I find myself unable to pick up the thread where I left off. I thought it would be interesting to present one of these here as a rough example of my work. There are some mature themes, so take that under advisement. If you are not mature enough to deal with adult content, be mature enough not to read it. Originally published on FictionPress.com under the pen name _avmorgan_.

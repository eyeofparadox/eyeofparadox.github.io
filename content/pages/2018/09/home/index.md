### Where is this project going?

**Child of Paradox** was intended to be an online comic/graphic novel about a girl discovering her own potential in a world torn by paradox. The idea is still alive, but the demands of that project floored me. I still want to tell her story, set in a realm where gods still involve themselves in mortal affairs; where magic thrives and technology withered--kept alive in secret or in isolation.

I got the urge to burn it, along with older projects like **The Eve of Paradox** and **The Threshold**, and see what could rise from the ashes. A consequence of that is shutting down this lost reboot and the site devoted to it. The posts and pages will move to [**eyeofparadox**](https://eyeofparadox.com/pages/) and the project will be managed from my [GitHub](https://github.com/eyeofparadox).

The new project is currently in development, and a new blog (TBD) will be used to share work on the characters and events that shape the story. In the meantime, you can still find work related to this project on **eyeofparadox** and in my ArtStation portfolio, I will consider adding a project specific gallery, some means of distributing premium "fundraising" content, and a flood of notes, as time permits.

### A child of paradox... still

Meet Avonlea, a young adventurer born in a world torn by Paradox, facing the end of her days at the Academy and the beginning of an epic journey of painful enlightenment and self discovery.

**A Glimpse of the Path...**

Her story starts out in her final year of initiation at the academy, when her investigation of the massacre in which her mother died leads her to become involved once more in the underworld, where she had an unwitting apprenticeship in cat-burglary as a child, prior to her admission to the academy.

Her escape from the massacre, through the ruins of an ancient city buried beneath the port, city and outlying areas of Avon (after which she's named), left her an orphan in the streets from the age of seven to nine. Her familiarity with the ruins of Aeslyn Tear was a close held secret until a traumatic flashback forced her to share the details of her childhood tragedy with two of her closest friends.

One of them, for serious reasons of his own, insisted on having her lead an expedition into the depths of Aeslyn Tear, prompting the lords of the underworld to target him for elimination, before his campaign to probe the ruins could be mounted.

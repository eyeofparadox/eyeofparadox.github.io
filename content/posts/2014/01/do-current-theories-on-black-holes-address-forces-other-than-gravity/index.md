From time to time, I stumble across a question I have to stop and ask, but I am usually in the middle of something that needs to be done. So, I put it off for later, often forgetting to even write the question down. I know this one is going to come back to plague me, so I am putting it out there in the hopes I can come back and do some research on it later, while giving the random visitor to my site a chance to comment on it or point me toward a source with something to say about the subject.

Obviously, I have not personally noted any discussion of what happens to the Strong and Weak Nuclear Forces when the force of Gravity collapses all structure in a Singularity. If I am interpreting what I have heard correctly, Black Hole Theory does address a few points concerning behavior related to the Electric and Magnetic Forces at the Event Horizon.

I will need to research and review a bit before I can even fully articulate the question I have on my mind, as at this moment I'm not sure how the Nuclear Forces are addressed in the Mass/Energy Equation (E=MC^2) though I am aware that the Nuclear Forces are critical to establishing and maintaining the structure of atoms, while Electric and Magnetic forces contribute to the interaction of particles and atoms, crucial to establishing and maintaining the structure of molecules.

Pardon the gross over-simplification; I am just sprinting through this and my focus here is on grasping the question, knowing that I'll have to firm up the context on pursuing it. I'm generally pretty good with Conceptual Physics, but my fluency in Math has always been an obstacle in interpreting the equations. So, I never looked too closely to see how the Math addresses the distribution of energy in the structure of matter.

Specifically, does Physics Math address the proportional investment of energy in the forces contributing to the structure of matter? Mass gives us a figure associated with Gravity, but there are other measurable attributes of matter that should allow us to deduce the energy budget of matter in more specific terms. Something that then allows us to address my question.

If the structure of matter breaks down in a Singularity, yet the Singularity still has mass, I would assume the energy invested in the structure, the balance of fundamental forces, remains. The question is, does the balance of fundamental forces remain? On the surface, we see an awesome force of gravity represented by a pure mathematical point.

Something is going on in the Electromagnetic between the Singularity and the Event Horizon, which I assume has a radius defining a sphere of influence where gravitic acceleration exceeds the speed of light. I've wondered before if photons can actually orbit a black hole at that radius. I have heard the Holographic Event Horizon theory, which sort of addresses the material structure question as information, but that still leaves me curious about what's happening with the fundamental forces.

I know that very smart people have been thinking about this for decades (closer to a century now), so I'm sure someone has given this careful thought. I may have to sit down and actually read Hawking's books (forever on my to-do list) once I'm no longer scrabbling to get on my feet. I've always taken the Einstein approach, to work out the problem for myself in thought experiments. I usually take myself to the same places real Physicists' theories go. So it's worthwhile speculation.

Still, it would save me some time if anyone can point to an article or publication that clearly addresses the question. On the extremely off chance the question was too obvious to get asked, because the answer is obvious--explained in the math--to a practicing physicist, then this is me asking for an English translation.

I have spent the past few years chasing after The Job and sliding down to the point where I'm scrambling to just grab A job. It's an old, familiar story, and the details aren't really that important. For the sake of my blog, all that matters is that I have not had much time to put my thoughts down, and no time to review or post any that might have been worth sharing. I'm not sure when that will change, but I'm going to take a crack at it. There's always the chance that my blog could open the door to some kind of paying work.

As always, I write because I'm ambushed by ideas on a regular basis. When I post something online, I'm either too wound up to realize I'm probably oversharing, or I'm caught in the spell of whatever odd insight has captured my attention. Occasionally, I put something out there that I've given serious thought to, and would not mind hearing other people's thoughts on. Right now, I'm thinking there are a lot of files mouldering on my hard drive, and it's high time I did something with them. Yep. That's right. I'm going to dump them out here and see what craziness shakes loose.

Grin.

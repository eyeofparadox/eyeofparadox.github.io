It's amazing how a little thing, like an email, can have a big impact. I received an invitation to open a store at [Cubebrush](https://cubebrush.co/david-b-roberson/), and the next thing I know, I have gone and started laying the groundwork for the promotion of Child of Paradox, restoring a ton of inactive social media, building a new Facebook page, registering for advertising, finally opening a Twitter account, and on and on....

At some point, this distraction from the creative work will be worth it, but what a reality  check! I did open that store, and posted a few images for download so I have some kind of content for sale. I got used to doing concept art that was never intended for sale or publication, so there's only a few images I'm certain have no copyright issues. To do anything with the rest, I have to track down the rights holders for a ton of images used as background elements.

Edit: Few people saw it, I'm sure, but the character model I posted via SketchFab was kind of terrible—so I removed it.

I am going back to work, now. Until my next wild notion turns into a post, TTFN.

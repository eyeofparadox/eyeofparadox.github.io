This is not my first blog. It is, however, the first time in a couple of years where I've been in a place where having a blog made sense. I let my art take over while my writing fell to the side, but plans are in the works to bring my art and writing together. The project I have in mind has gone by the title of Child of Paradox since the first ideas formed in High School, so many years ago.

Those ideas never left me, and they've been a source of inspiration through some long, hard times. Some are piled up in a chaos of notes, others are illustrations ranging from a few rough sketches, through generations of design and revision, to a form that can finally cohere into a visual story.

I don't know what it will take to get that story told (or shown), but now I have a place to begin picking up the scraps, kindling new flames from a bed of ashes. This site will hold the story behind the story, and help launch the project. I may tie things in to a Patreon site, but this site can also support contributions from those who find their way here and find they want to encourage my project with contributions of their own.

I'm not just speaking of financial support. I have an entire world to finish building, and there's a lot of potential for others to explore in it. The notes I will be sharing will form the pool from which the project will draw. I do not yet know which ideas will take hold, but I know there are probably more than I can ever fully realize. I welcome creative contributions as much as I hope for constructive C&C. Every contribution counts, and I will try to offer content worth contributing for.

To be fair, most of the stuff I have to start out with is rough and raw, a far cry from where I am focused now, but posting it all gives me a chance to review it, and remember what got me going in the first place, or kept me going when it seemed like all that work was really going nowhere. Such is the creative life.

If you love fantasy and science fiction, dipped in philosophy and tuned by paradox, you may enjoy sifting through the ashes with me and watching the phoenix emerge from them. At the very least, I hope you can find something interesting enough to keep track of my progress.

Thanks for joining me!

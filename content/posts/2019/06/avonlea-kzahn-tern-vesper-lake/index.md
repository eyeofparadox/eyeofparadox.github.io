I'll let you follow the link for the original posting details. I've been focused on testing out a workflow for creating the world of Aeirn in 3D for Child of Paradox. Like much of this sort of thing, it's also concept art for the series--and there is a lot of it on my portfolio and gallery sites. I am still working on the writing side of things too. I use the time my computer is tied up rendering to jot down new notes, sort through old notes, and work out details like the naming of characters. That last is a bit harder than it sounds, because I attempted to write parts of the story at different times and each time I renamed people to fit the roles they had in each version I explored.

It's kind of amazing how my perspective shifts, while trying to wrestle with the paradoxes and threads of the story. Up to the point where something is actually published, it's all a bit like a free-form dream. Everything can change, radically altering the whole scope of the story-universe. It's part of why I started posting drafts and notes, to sort of commit to an approach while in a working phase. When the phase ends and I spend a little time away from the writing, I end up letting go of that commitment, though the notes and drafts do tend to have some inertia. It's hard to re-assimilate them for a fresh approach, and that can put the brakes on an attempt to get the ball rolling again.

It makes the behind-the-scenes aspect of these postings a trick. I never know which notes are really spoilers, which are teasers, and which are outright red-herrings. Today's post, I'm sharing a bit more nomenclature, having gotten started on researching name meanings with Avonlea. Adding other characters to that probe resulted in a few interesting, innate relationships between the various names my characters have gone by. The list is not ordered in any particular way; just the order in which I was prompted to go online while updating notes. The first on the list is an alias for Avalon; rather, the identity he starts out with before getting dragged into a very intimate relationship with Avonlea.

**Evan / Even ▼**

Evan is a Welsh masculine given name derived from "Iefan", a Welsh form for the name John. In other languages it could be compared to "Ivan", "Ian", and "Juan"; the name John itself is derived from the ancient Hebrew name יְהֹוחָנָן Yəhôḥānān, which means "Yahweh is gracious".

![Fly By](images/a-aism-space-art-fly-by-0505081.jpg)

Once again, I am posting images from my space art portfolio. This is a reworking of one of the first space art cover illustrations I attempted, but never submitted, for Analog. It was created in Photoshop as part of a new series of space art conceived as "variations on a theme" using similar elements in different ways. In keeping with the role of a concept artist, this series is supposed to demonstrate an ability to create a number of detailed proof images quickly, so each image in this series was produced in an evening or afternoon. The fact that the images all share a common origin and elements also gives them a kind of storyboard quality.

This version is closer to the original composition for the asteroids, and features a different look for the space fighter -- a scout design. I think that either of these pictures would work as cover art or illustrations for a sci-fi magazine or web site. They also show that I seem to have a visual affinity for blue! Anyway, these pictures seemed like a nice end-of-the-month addition. Enjoy!

Once more, I thought it would be nice to add a little visual content to the eye of paradox by posting one of the images from my voidscape collection of space art. This is actually a pre-visualization done at a smaller scale than I normally work in Photoshop, using small Terragen renders, to help with a work in progress. To those familiar with my Art is Murder gallery as Alexandrea V. Morgan, the planets first appeared on a wallpaper graphic titled "Artemis and Athena" which was a sneak-preview of the the project I was working on. However, this piece uses the planets in the same orientation they were originally developed, rather than the vertical composition I posted on Art is Murder, to try to keep the lighting of the planets somewhat consistent with the lighting of the terrain.

When I moved on to the final version, I decided to try the vertical composition using a different rendering of the landscape, changing the lighting and atmospheric settings in Terragen to fit. The two images are different enough from each other to be seen as distinct interpretations of a theme. Because I kind of like the way this version worked out, I'm going to create a larger scale version when time permits. As a final note, it was once worth visiting my gallery on Art is Murder (alas, it's long gone... you might be able to find my older works as [avmorgan](http://avmorgan.deviantart.com/) on deviantart.com) since the images I've posted here are cropped to fit the article space.

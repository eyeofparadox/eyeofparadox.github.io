[![Above the Horizon](images/a-aism-xscape.jpg "a-aism-xscape")](http://eyeofparadox.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/a-aism-xscape.jpg)

This is my first attempt to feature some of my artwork here on the eye of paradox. I have always had a strong interest in becoming a professional artist, in spite of having little time and insufficient resources to develop my skills to that level. I started out with the right intentions, pursuing an art degree, but the path I started on led down a different and darker route. I never gave up on the idea, even though it's taken a long time to get to where I am now as an artist and a writer. In the hopes of breaking into publication creating science fiction themed cover art, I became interested in creating voidscapes, images set in outer space. I have learned enough by now to know how much more I have to learn to achieve that goal. I have continued to improve with each work, and I will post some of my more recent efforts or even works in progress as the whim strikes me. Of course, if I get some kind of response to my efforts, the whim might strike more frequently.

Funny how that works, hmm?

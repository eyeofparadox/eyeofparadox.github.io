“Detailing the dynamics of point paradox has never been easy, but the founding principle is prime awareness, the awareness of one, all and none" she elaborated, settling lightly on the arm of the couch.

"Point paradox is initially a question of absolutes. An absolute can be represented with a value of ‘one’, ‘zero’ and ‘infinite’. These values are all essentially equal, depending on perspective.

"The evolution of the soul begins with the exploration of this prime awareness, which is initially the struggle of one to comprehend the duality of all and none.

"A relative duality is also fostered, the absolute value of one acquiring relative values of positive one and negative one. This happens inadvertently; one simply can not help but reflect the primal duality of all and nothing within oneself, unconsciously cultivating the perspectives of ‘all within one’ and ‘one within all’.

"The impulse drives the evolution of the soul in opposite directions, diving into the heart of two separate spheres, thrusting them towards each other at the extreme ends of infinite loops, causing them to confront each other as opposites in the shadow of the very point where they emerged as one."

She gave a slight, helpless shrug, as if in apology for her inability to illustrate her point, and then tilted her head with a grin.

Rising to her feet, she walked toward the mirror hanging over the mantle, eyes fixed on her reflection.

"In one sense, the soul is confronting her own reflection, but her awareness places her on both sides of the glass—so to speak—forcing her to literally confront herself.

"Upon entering each other, they re-enter the common sphere of their soul. This is the point where the dreamer enters the dream. This is what sparks the first form of consciousness.”

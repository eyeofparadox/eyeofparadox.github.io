“A soul is absolute and absolutes are autonomous,” she asserted firmly. “A mind is paradoxical, acting as an inclusive, exclusive and occlusive interface between absolutes, abstractions and manifestations. A mind, with the absolute of a soul as its foundation, is the focus of existence, whether real, surreal or ideal. In short, the mind is the medium of existence, and a single mind can coordinate the disposition of the absolute, the absolutes, and any distillation derived there from.

"Space and time are mental constructs acting as filtering and structuring mediums for the primary media of existence, information. Information exists in three primary states, as matter, energy and thought. Existence can be looked at as a state of processing information. Since the best representation of a thing is the actual, natural expression of the thing itself, obviously the manifestation of things is a key function of this process.

“I could go on in that vein,” she sighed, smiling, “but I possess this understanding in myself and am conscious that I would better serve the truth by representing it in myself than in words. As long as I endure, I can endeavor to put my understanding into words, but if I fail to embrace the truth I have realized I simply do not have enough time in my life to explain what it is that I understand. It is far simpler to say that I understand myself, and to undertake the manifestation of that understanding.”

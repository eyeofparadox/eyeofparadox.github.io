I've been scratching out ideas since the writing bug first bit me in grade school. Somewhere in the back of my mind I always had this notion that I was going to devote some part of my life to writing. Of course, I've spent much more time thinking, while trying to _find_ time to get anything written! Inevitably, when the time came to start writing, I had thoughts waiting to be expressed. I used to just spill them out in a notepad and file them away, but having tripped over a link to Helium a few months ago (AN: this was back in 2007; the site is long gone now), I found a more interesting place to put them. After publishing my tenth article, I got an itch for something more. I wanted to be able to continue to explore the ideas that bit me, and that really calls for something more like a blog. So, even though I will (or at least intended to, at the time) continue to publish articles on Helium, I am also going to be exploring some of them here in more detail.

One other benefit of doing that here is that readers who are interested will be able to chip in here with comments and questions. I cannot promise to respond to everything, but thoughtful contributions are welcome.

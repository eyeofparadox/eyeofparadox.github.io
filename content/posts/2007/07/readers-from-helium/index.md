Among the features not provided for contributors on the now-defunct Helium writer's website was a way for readers to respond directly to the writers. While it was active, the only way for readers to respond on Helium was by posting their own thoughts on the topic at hand. Those who were so inclined were welcome to do so, there, but I imagined that not all responses would have been suited to that approach, so I invited my readers to respond here if they preferred.

I originally told eye of paradox readers, if you are coming here from Helium, general comments and questions can be made in response to this post. At present, this is the only place I know you can still find these articles, so if you are following up on a specific article, you're probably reading the post here in the eye of paradox. If there's an article you remember that I have not re-posted here yet, you can mention it below and I will add it. At present, my writing pursuits are limited by the amount of free time I have outside of work and school, and that will probably remain the case until I find a way to make some kind of living off of writing or art.

In response to any questions about my motivations as a writer, or a human being, I choose to write about whatever seems worth thinking about, from any perspective that offers insight. I do not always identify the perspective I am working from, because once I go to that perspective it becomes central to what I am thinking at that point. When possible, I strive to reserve my own opinions for myself; they continue to evolve and refine themselves, shifting to reflect changes in my experience and understanding. It is not necessary to cling to ideas to have a firm grip on them, and even the ones worth holding on to need to be tossed around a bit before we can truly grasp them. I think, as long as my readers can keep that in mind while reading, potential misunderstandings can be avoided.

It seems that the itch to start working on a book has come back to me. It has to be an insane impulse, because with school and work I have no idea where I'll find time to actually write anything. Then there's the fact that I'll be moving in the next few weeks and looking for a new job. I know I must be crazy. Of course, that's not a new feeling for me!

I have been scratching for article ideas for Helium, because that odd cent or two might eventually add up to something! At the rate I'm going, I only need to post a couple thousand more articles to make rent. Heh. I do hope to find some way to make money writing or illustrating, but the whole money aspect of life has never been my strong suit. Of course, being a little gender bent has not made it easy to find stability in employment. It's hard to hold down a regular job when you're clinging to your sanity by your fingernails. Of course, I can't blame everything on being transgendered. I have plenty of problems just being INTP/INFP.

I never had a shot at being the typical guy. Or girl, unfortunately. I'm not sure what happened to get me to open up about these things where they could conceivable be tracked back to my real world coordinates. I guess I am finally comfortable with the fact that I'm weird. I always will be. I am hoping that helps me when it comes to writing, because a good writer writes what s/he knows. Maybe I will stop strangling my work by trying to keep what I know out of it in fear of someone figuring me out.

Oh, you know what I'm talking about if you've peeked at The Eve of Paradox. Pulling that out and posting it was what got my creative juices flowing again. I'm going to take on the mad, weird, gender bending issues that helped inspire it. I'm going to let the things I want to say get said. I am confident that I will be able to take that story way beyond the desolate shore I chose to strand it on a few years ago.

I have certainly found an interesting way to go about killing myself. I'm almost certain to work myself to death trying to fit this in too. Too bad it pays so poorly!
